  {"id":"abalmedinaConocerPeron2022","abstract":"Juan Manuel Abal Medina fue, a los veintisiete años, el hombre elegido por Perón para construir la estrategia de su retorno en noviembre de 1972, luego de diecisiete años de destierro. Formado en el nacionalismo católi-co, hermano de Fernando -fundador de Montoneros, al que acababan de matar-, peronista recién llegado al Movimiento, Abal Medina recorrió el laberinto de cada uno de los sectores en pugna para traer a Perón al país, cuando la violencia ya golpeaba desde el subsuelo del peronismo. Con una prosa emotiva y por momentos devastadora, quien fue el último retén para impedir el enfrentamiento relata cómo se fue urdiendo la compleja trama de los hechos, cuyas esquirlas se derramarían durante la década de 1970 y que aún hoy, medio siglo después, siguen conmoviendo. Las conversaciones secretas de su hermano con el escritor Leopoldo Ma-rechal, determinantes para el secuestro y muerte del general Aramburu, el conflicto jamás revelado entre Cámpora y Perón sobre la presidencia, los pormenores de la tragedia anunciada de Ezeiza, las negociaciones secretas entre metalúrgicos y montoneros para frenar la dinámica del conflicto, el crimen sin retorno de José Ignacio Rucci, y la entronización de José López Rega e Isabel en el poder doméstico son parte de una pintura vibrante, árida y desoladora que atraviesan estas memorias que Abal Medina vuelca por primera vez en un libro. Más que un relato sobre los años 70 y el peronismo, Conocer a Perón es la visión lúcida de un testigo y protagonista privilegiado que vio y alertó sobre el drama inminente, mientras se acababa el diálogo y se velaban las armas.

  {"id":"abalmedinaManualCienciaPolitica2010","abstract":"\"Este manual analiza los principales aspectos del funcionamiento de la política a través de los diversos enfoques y modelos que componen actualmente la ciencia política. El Estado, la democracia, los regímenes políticos, los sistemas electorales y los partidos políticos son algunos de los fenómenos estudiados en esta obra, que presenta en cada caso los debates más relevantes y actuales al interior de la disciplina, a nivel internacional y en nuestro país. Por lo tanto, se trata de un texto valioso tanto para el estudiante que se inicia en la ciencia política como para el profesional que busca actualizarse y especializarse en esta área temática. A esta altura, un signo de madurez de una disciplina es la aparición de la necesidad y demanda de buenos manuales que destilen el estado de los conocimientos respectivos, y faciliten su estudio y difusión. El presente Manual cumple muy bien esta función: recorre un amplio y pertinente temario; presenta un cuadro comprensivo y actualizado de buena parte de los temas relevantes a una concepción moderna de la disciplina; está escrito en un estilo asequible, pero que no elude presentar y discutir complejos asuntos; y se atiene a niveles analíticos y empíricos, aunque no omite tomar posición en varias cuestiones normativas y abrirse, por lo tanto, a polémicas, tal como corresponde a una concepción socialmente comprometida de las ciencias sociales. \" --Contratapa","author":[{"family":"Abal Medina","given":"Juan Manuel"}],"citation-key":"abalmedinaManualCienciaPolitica2010","collection-title":"Manuales","edition":"1. ed","event-place":"Buenos Aires","ISBN":"978-950-23-1707-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"319","publisher":"Eudeba","publisher-place":"Buenos Aires","source":"K10plus ISBN","title":"Manual de ciencia política","type":"book"},

Omnidirectional microphone elements with 2 mm-diameter capsules and 1 mm-diameter wire mounts produce a nearly acoustically transparent array, and provide a simpliﬁed mathematical framework for processing measured signals. The wire mounts are ﬁtted onto a 1.6 cm-diameter tube forming the microphone stand, with the microphones arranged above the tube so that acoustic energy can propagate freely across the array. The wire microphone mounts have some ﬂexibility, and the array may be conﬁgured. Detachable arms with small speakers are used to estimate the element positions with an accuracy better than the 2 mm microphone diameter.","author":[{"family":"Abel","given":"Jonathan S"},{"family":"Bryan","given":"Nicholas J"},{"family":"Skare","given":"Travis"},{"family":"Kolar","given":"Miriam"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Patty"},{"family":"Mostowﬁ","given":"Darius"},{"family":"Iii","given":"Julius O Smith"}],"citation-key":"abelConfigurableMicrophoneArray2009","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"A Conﬁgurable Microphone Array with Acoustically Transparent Omnidirectional Elements","type":"article-journal"},

The adopted features describe spectral characteristics of monophonic sounds and rely on the previous segmentation of the signal and the estimation of pitch. The dataset is composed by 1007 tones from 27 musical instruments ranging from orchestral sounds (strings, woodwinds, brass) to pop/electronic instruments (bass, electric and distorted guitar). The extracted features are then classiﬁed by widely used pattern recognition techniques. A thorough evaluation of the resulting performances and comparative analysis with previous works is presented. Quadratic Discriminant Analysis shows an error rate of 7.19% for the individual instruments and 3.23% for instrument families. These results are by far superior to the performances of other classiﬁcation methods (Canonical Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machines, Nearest Neighbours).

One Simple Technique to Boost Writing, Learning and Thinking - for Students, Academics and Nonfiction Book Writers\". The key to good and efficient writing lies in the intelligent organisation of ideas and notes. This book helps students, academics and other knowledge workers to get more done, write intelligent texts and learn for the long run. It teaches you how to take smart notes and ensure they bring you and your projects forward. The Take Smart Notes principle is based on established psychological insight and draws from a tried and tested note-taking technique: the Zettelkasten. This is the first comprehensive guide and description of this system in English, and not only does it explain how it works, but also why. It suits students and academics in the social sciences and humanities, nonfiction writers and others who are in the business of reading, thinking and writing. Instead of wasting your time searching for your notes, quotes or references, you can focus on what really counts: thinking, understanding and developing new ideas in writing. Dr. Sönke Ahrens is a writer and researcher in the field of education and social science. He is the author of the award-winning book “Experiment and Exploration: Forms of World Disclosure” (Springer).

Esa inmediatez dio el tono de nuestras reuniones. El curso se llamaba «Cómo leer a Copi». Me pareció que la respuesta más plausible era postular una especie de continuo con el que podríamos «seguir» leyendo, a Copi o a quien sea, indefinidamente, creando un mundo que siempre pasará a otro mundo que lo incluya, y éste a otro más… Con la hipótesis complementaria de que todo pasaje es una transformación, ya estábamos listos para contarnos el cuento maravilloso de Copi.","author":[{"family":"Aira","given":"César"}],"call-number":"MLCS 91/18430 (P)","citation-key":"airaCopi1991","collection-title":"El Escribiente","edition":"1. ed","event-place":"Rosario [Argentina]","ISBN":"978-950-99766-0-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1991"]]},"language":"es","note":"Item ID: _:n10","number-of-pages":"121","publisher":"B.

  {"id":"airaEpisodioVidaPintor2000","abstract":"Johan Moritz Rugendas, a quien el mismo Humboldt admiraba como a un maestro en el arte pictórico de la fisionomía de la naturaleza, fue el mejor de los pocos pintores viajeros que hubo en Occidente. De su segundo viaje a América, que se extendió a lo largo de su juventud, de 1831 a 1847, resultaron miles de óleos, acuarelas y dibujos cuyo objeto, como lo indicaba el género, fueron primordialmente las selvas y montañas tropicales. Pero el objetivo secreto de su viaje fue la Argentina: sólo allí, pensaba, en el vacío misterioso que había en el punto equidistante de los horizontes sobre las llanuras inmensas, podría encontrar el reverso de su arte. La visitó en dos oportunidades: en 1847, en Buenos Aires, registró en abundancia los paisajes y tipos rioplatenses, y fue ésta su visita más fructífera. Diez años antes, sin embargo, una visita breve y dramática a Mendoza fue la que le dio la ocasión de aventurarse al centro soñado. Sobre el rastro lentísimo de las carretas gigantes, Rugendas se puso, con urgencia infantil, en el camino de la recta interpampeana a la espera de aquello que, por fin, desafiara a su lápiz y lo obligara a crear un procedimiento nuevo. Lo acompañó el pintor alemán Robert Krause. Sin dudas Rugendas rozó, siquiera por unos instantes, ese centro imposible, sólo que a un precio inmenso, casi se diría monstruoso de exorbitante.

Bien sea rompiendo lanzas en favor de la ficción de entretenimiento de autores como Stevenson, como sucede en «Evasión», o elogiando la placentera «inutilidad» de la literatura en «Discurso breve», texto con el que inauguró el Festival de Literatura de Berlín de 2016, los ensayos de César Aira son luminosos y contundentes a un tiempo. El procedimiento literario propuesto por Raymond Roussel, su referente en la vanguardia, o aquel otro en el que analiza el concepto de «genialidad» a través de la figura de Salvador Dalí, otro de sus grandes modelos, completan este volumen, una extraordinaria recopilación que se cierra con otra joya made in Aira: un ensayo sobre la temática propia del ensayo.","author":[{"family":"Aira","given":"César"}],"citation-key":"airaEvasionOtrosEnsayos2017","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",11,23]]},"language":"es","note":"Item ID: _:n4","publisher":"ePubLibre","title":"Evasión y otros ensayos","type":"book"},

Sobre el arte contemporáneo es la alocución con la que César Aira inauguró el congreso Artescritura, que tuvo lugar en Madrid en 2010 y que se proponía superar la brecha que separa a escritores y artistas visuales. En La Habana, en cambio, parte de un recorrido por la casa museo del escritor Lezama Lima, realizado durante una visita a Cuba en el año 2000, y desemboca en una crónica del viaje por los museos de la ciudad y los objetos que allí se exponen. Estos dos imponentes textos de uno de los autores clave de las letras hispanas vuelven a incidir en algunos de los temas predilectos de Aira: la relación entre arte y literatura, el proceso de creación, el arte de lo incompleto y, en definitiva, la veracidad de la escritura.","author":[{"family":"Aira","given":"César"}],"citation-key":"airaSobreArteContemporaneo2013","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",1,1]]},"language":"es","note":"Item ID: _:n7","publisher":"ePubLibre","title":"Sobre el arte contemporáneo & En la Habana","type":"book"},

La primera po­dría titularse «Sexo, drogas y punk». La segunda, «Hay vida después del punk». Viv Albertine llega a Londres en 1958 con cuatro años, procedente de Sídney. Estas memorias arrancan con su infancia y adolescencia, entre descubrimientos musicales –John Lennon, los Kinks, Marc Bolan–, conciertos -–de los Stones, David Bowie...–, primeras escapadas –a Ám­sterdam– y primeras experiencias adultas –con ladillas incorporadas–. A finales de los setenta, dos encuentros lo cambian todo: conoce a Mick Jones y descubre a Patti Smith. A partir de ahí, Viv se integra en la emergente escena punk y vive en primera línea aquellos años de revuelta, provocación y excesos: los Sex Pistols, Malcolm McLaren, Vivienne Westwood, los Clash, Sid Vicious y Johnny Thunders, la formación del grupo de chicas The Slits, en el que toca la guitarra, los locales míticos, el Soho, con sus cines porno y sus clubs, los conciertos salvajes, la heroína, las peleas con skinheads, el des­cubrimiento del free jazz y la gira a la que invitan a Don Cherry..., hasta que a principios de los ochenta su banda se disuelve. Arranca entonces la cara B, con la necesidad de reinventarse, el interés por el cine, un aborto, una hija, el cáncer de cuello de útero, el divorcio tras un largo matrimonio y su nueva situación como mujer madura, tema al que dedica una canción: «Confessions of a MILF».</content></div></div>","author":[{"family":"Albertine","given":"Viv"}],"citation-key":"albertineRopaMusicaChicos2017","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",4,10]]},"language":"es","note":"Item ID: _:n0","publisher":"Anagrama","title":"Ropa música chicos","type":"book"},

Due to a lack of standardisation of the instrument, the results of using these techniques can vary greatly between instruments from different manufacturers. This resource discusses new and known techniques from the clarinet and wind-instrument lexicon, noting their differences when played on the contrabass clarinet, with particular focus on the cross-compatibility between instruments from the three most-used manufacturers – Leblanc, Selmer, and Eppelsheim. Through collaboration with composers, new techniques were developed with ways of composing for them. Included are fingering charts for the altissimo register, quarter-tones, multiphonics, colour-fingering combinations, and double trills for each of the three contrabass clarinets, audio and video examples of many of the techniques performed on each instrument, and recordings of new compositions created through the collaborative process and improvisations demonstrating the use of the techniques. The results of this thesis bring greater attention to the contrabass clarinet and provide tools for promoting its use among composers and performers.","author":[{"family":"Alder","given":"Jason William"}],"citation-key":"alderCompendiumSonicPossibilities2021","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Compendium of Sonic Possibilities of the Contrabass Clarinet: A Study of Cross-Compatibility and Composer Collaboration","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"Andersen2016","abstract":"Seiring dengan kemajuan ilmu pengetahuan dan teknologi yang menjadi pusat perhatian dunia. Maka manusia dituntut untuk menciptakan peralatan-peralatan canggih untuk teknologi muktahir. Baik itu dalam bidang bisnis, perdagangan, kesehatan, militer, pendidikan, komunikasi dan budaya maupun bidang-bidang lainnya. Maka teknologi ini membawa perubahan pada peralatan-peralatan yang dulunya bekerja secara analog mulai dikembangkan secara digital, dan bahkan yang bekerjanya secara manual sekarang banyak dikembangkan secara otomatis, seperti kamera digital, handycam, dan sebagainya, dalam pembacaan pengukuran juga sudah dikembangkan ke dalam teknik digital. Contohnya perangkat Load Cell. Dan keuntungan menggunakan Load Cell adalah untuk mempermudah dalam pembacaan data untuk meminimalkan kesalahan dalam pembacaan data yang disebabkan adanya human error.Pada pemilihan Load Cell bertujuan untuk memilih kecocokan dalam membuat rancang bangun alat uji tarik kapasitas 3 ton, dimana dalam pemilihan ini kami memilih jenis load cell “S” karna alat yang kita rancang adalah uji tarik bukan uji tekan.

  {"id":"Antonelli1992","abstract":"The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants explores mathematical models of developmental processes and structures of plants, and illustrates them using state-of-the-art computer-generated images. Plant models which grow, interact with the environment, produce flowers and fruits, and finally die, have an immense intuitive appeal of \"bringing life into a computer.\" In front of a graphics monitor it is easy to forget the underlying mathematical formulae and simply look at plants growing, self-replicating, responding to external factors, even mutating. Without compromising the mathematical rigor of presentation the authors have tried to preserve this \"touch of magic\" accompanying in their research. The following areas receive particular attention: methods for the modeling and rendering of plants which are suitable for realistic image synthesis; the scientific potential of computer graphics in the visualization of biological structures and processes; the relationship between control mechanisms employed by li- ing plants and the resulting complex developmental sequences and structures; and the relationship between developmental processes, self-similarity and fractals. The formalism of L-systems are adopted as the primary mathematical vehicle used to express developmental processes. The notion of L-systems was conceived in 1968 by Aristid Lindenmayer as a formal model of plant development. Its exceptional elegance was promptly recognized by mathematicians, who soon developed a comprehensive theory of L-systems. However, only recently has computer graphics revealed the full potential of L-systems applied to plant modeling. Although the focus is on the original results of joint research led by the authors, a survey of alternative methods for plant modeling is also included.","author":[{"family":"Antonelli","given":"Peter L."}],"citation-key":"Antonelli1992","container-title":"SIAM Review","DOI":"10.1137/1034030","ISSN":"0036-1445","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1992"]]},"page":"142–143","title":"The algorithmic beauty of plants (przemyslaw prusinkiewicz and aristid lindenmayer)","type":"article-journal","volume":"34"},
  {"id":"antoniouAcousticalProperties3D2021","abstract":"With focused ultrasound (FUS) gaining popularity as a therapeutic modality for brain diseases, the need for skull phantoms that are suitable for evaluating FUS protocols is increasing. In the current study, the acoustical properties of several three-dimensional (3D) printed thermoplastic samples were evaluated to assess their suitability to mimic human skull and bone accurately. Samples were 3D printed using eight commercially available thermoplastic materials. The acoustic properties of the printed samples, including attenuation coefficient, speed of sound, and acoustic impedance, were investigated using transmission-through and pulse-echo techniques. The ultrasonic attenuation, estimated at a frequency of 1.1 MHz, varied from approximately 7 to 32 dB/cm. The frequency dependence of attenuation was described by a power law in the frequency range of 0.2–3.5 MHz, and the exponential index of frequency was found to vary from 1.30 to 2.24. The longitudinal velocity of 2.7 MHz sound waves was in the range of 1700–3050 m/s. The results demonstrate that thermoplastics could potentially be used for the 3D construction of high-quality skull phantoms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Antoniou","given":"Anastasia"},{"family":"Evripidou","given":"Nikolas"},{"family":"Giannakou","given":"Marinos"},{"family":"Constantinides","given":"Georgios"},{"family":"Damianou","given":"Christakis"}],"citation-key":"antoniouAcousticalProperties3D2021","container-title":"The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America","DOI":"10.1121/10.0004772","ISSN":"0001-4966, 1520-8524","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"2854-2864","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Acoustical properties of 3D printed thermoplastics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubs.aip.org/jasa/article/149/4/2854/1067948/Acoustical-properties-of-3D-printed-thermoplastics","volume":"149"},

  {"id":"antonopoulosOntologyCosmologyXenakis2005","abstract":"Xenakis’ world speculation outcome seems to constitute a major adjusting factor in his first formalized compositions. Poetics’ initial laws, being subjected to ontological-cosmological theses combined with mathematics and modern physics, had to be invented, i.e. to become a creation anew. As Ex nihilo creation together with the Parmenidean being, keep outstanding positions in Xenakis’ reasoning, we focus on several of their philosophical aspects and epistemological reverberations. The impact of ontological and cosmological principles on poetics’ creation and compositional processes proves to be qualified with structuralizing potential, endowed therefore with functionality. Thus, ontology and cosmology, together with the omnipresence of heuristics and intuition, lay the foundations of Xenakis’ first formalized works’ poetics.","author":[{"family":"Antonopoulos","given":"Antonios"}],"citation-key":"antonopoulosOntologyCosmologyXenakis2005","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Ontology & Cosmology in I.

  {"id":"apperleyGenreGameStudies2006","abstract":"This article examines the notion of genre in video games. The main argument is that the market-based categories of genre that have been developed in the context of video games obscure the new medium's crucial defining feature, by dividing them into categories (loosely) organized by their similarities to prior forms of mediation. The article explores the inherent tension between the conception of video games as a unified new media form, and the current fragmented genre-based approach that explicitly or implicitly concatenates video games with prior media forms. This tension reflects the current debate, within the fledgling discipline of Game Studies, between those who advocate narrative as the primary tool for understanding video games, “narratologists,” and those that oppose this notion, “ludologists.” In reference to this tension, the article argues that video game genres be examined in order to assess what kind of assumptions stem from the uncritical acceptance of genre as a descriptive category. Through a critical examination of the key game genres, this article will demonstrate how the clearly defined genre boundaries collapse to reveal structural similarities between the genres that exist within the current genre system, defined within the context of visual aesthetic or narrative structure. The inability of the current genre descriptions to locate and highlight these particular features suggests that to privilege the categories of the visual and narrative is a failure to understand the medium. The article concludes by suggesting that the tension between “ludology” and “narratology” can be more constructively engaged by conceptualizing video games as operating in the interplay between these two taxonomies of genre.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Apperley","given":"Thomas H."}],"citation-key":"apperleyGenreGameStudies2006","container-title":"Simulation & Gaming","container-title-short":"Simulation & Gaming","DOI":"10.1177/1046878105282278","ISSN":"1046-8781, 1552-826X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",3]]},"language":"en","page":"6-23","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Genre and game studies: Toward a critical approach to video game genres","title-short":"Genre and game studies","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1046878105282278","volume":"37"},

Resulta sorprendente que nunca hayan sido publicadas en libro y hayan permanecido desconocidas para los lectores, hasta hoy. Tanto desde el punto de vista literario, como desde la perspectiva histórica o sociológica, los textos escritos por Arlt en Río de Janeiro se encuentran a la altura de lo mejor de su producción periodística. Pero además, por tratarse de las primeras crónicas que escribió fuera del país, funcionaron también como laboratorio para las notas de viaje que escribió a lo largo de su carrera. Los artículos aquí reunidos ofrecen un retrato muy lúcido, preciso, con gran sentido del humor, no sólo de Brasil de 1930, sino también de la Argentina de la misma época. A las primeras notas laudatorias, le siguen textos cada vez más críticos y cáusticos, en los cuales Buenos Aires y la sociedad argentina aparecen como el contrapunto moderno y civilizado para el atraso en que se encontraba Brasil y la que entonces era su capital.","author":[{"family":"Arlt","given":"Roberto"}],"citation-key":"arltAguafuertesCariocas1930","issued":{"date-parts":[["1930"]]},"language":"es","note":"Item ID: _:n0","publisher":"ePubLibre","title":"Aguafuertes cariocas","type":"book"},

  {"id":"arrianoAnabasisAlejandroMagno150","abstract":"Lucio Flavio Arriano nació en 85-90 d. C. en Nicomedia (Bitinia; hoy Ismit, en la Turquía asiática occidental), donde se educó y fue sacerdote de Deméter y Perséfone. Ocupó el cargo de procónsul de Bética y legado imperial en Capadocia, para retirarse por último a Atenas en calidad de arconte (145-146). Gran parte de su considerable obra, en griego, se ha perdido, pero sabemos que escribió tratados filosóficos sobre Epicteto, militares e históricos. La «Anábasis» («expedición hacia el interior del país») se integra en la larga tradición de escritos dedicados a Alejandro Magno. Arriano, a quien la crítica considera un testimonio de primer orden sobre el rey macedonio, lo muestra como un vigoroso hombre de acción y un pensador político que trata de lograr la unidad de los pueblos, aunque en la vertiente pasional no es ajeno al ansia de gloria. Arriano se distancia de las biografías retóricas y mitologizantes que hacían furor en su tiempo, y presenta su obra como un «libro profesional», dirigido a gentes de la carrera civil y militar, casi como un manual monográfico de historia militar centrado en las campañas de Alejandro. Así, en este primer volumen de la «Anábasis» aparecen, narrados con un estilo recio que no hace concesión alguna al ornato innecesario, los lances principales de las aventuras y conquistas alejandrinas: campañas en Tracia, represión de Tebas, expedición contra los persas, victorias en Éfeso y Mileto, Tarso y Tiro, Gaza y Menfis, fundación de Alejandría, organización administrativa de Egipto, combates contra Darío, triunfos en Babilonia, Susa, Persépolis, Bactria... Como autor del siglo II d. C., Arriano posee una gran cultura y tiene el referente de la Atenas clásica; en su faceta de historiador, pretende ser un segundo Jenofonte, como se echa de ver en el préstamo del título.","author":[{"family":"Arriano","given":"Lucio Flavio"}],"citation-key":"arrianoAnabasisAlejandroMagno150","issued":{"date-parts":[["150",1,1]]},"language":"es","note":"Item ID: _:n4","publisher":"ePubLibre","title":"Anábasis de Alejandro Magno Libros I-III","type":"book"},

Posteriormente Alejandro decide el regreso bajando por el río Hidaspes, afluente del Indo, enlazando con este último hasta llegar a Pátala. Continua por Gadrosia, Carmania, visitando la tumba de Ciro en Pasargada y concluyendo en Persia, donde finalmente muere. El libro VIII se conoce en español como «La historia índica», aunque originalmente el título se limitaba a «Indiké».

No longer sidelined, aesthetics has grown in confidence. While this recent development brings with it a return to the work of the canonical authors (most notably Baumgarten and Kant), some contemporary scholars reject the traditional focus on epistemology and theorize aesthetics in its ontological connotations. It is according to this shift that speculative realists have proclaimed aesthetics as \"first philosophy\" and as speculative in nature. With speculative realism aesthetics no longer necessarily implies human agents. This is in alignment with the general speculative realist framework for thinking all kinds of processes, entities, and objects as free from our all-pervasive anthropocentrism, which states, always, that everything is \"for us.\" This special volume of Speculations explores the ramifications of what could be termed the new speculative aesthetics.

  {"id":"Avanessian2017","abstract":"El aceleracionismo es una herejía política: sostiene que hay deseos, tecnologías y procesos que el capitalismo hace surgir y de los que se alimenta, pero que no puede contener; y que es necesario acelerar estos procesos para empujar al sistema más allá de sus límites. Teniendo como antecedentes teóricos al notable “Fragmento sobre las máquinas” de Marx, los volúmenes sobre capitalismo y esquizofrenia de Deleuze y Guattari, y la ficción especulativa de autores como Samuel Buttler, William Gibson y J.G. Ballard (para quien “el futuro es una mejor guía para el presente que el pasado”), los aceleracionistas se preguntan cómo liberar las fuerzas productivas cautivas bajo la ideología neoliberal, para redirigirlas hacia objetivos comunes. En este proyecto, la actual base material no necesita ser destruida, sino que es reapropiada como plataforma de lanzamiento hacia un futuro postcapitalista. Pues, ciertamente, aún no sabemos lo que un cuerpo tecno-social moderno puede hacer. Desde la publicación en 2013 del “Manifiesto por una Política Aceleracionista” de Alex Williams y Nick Srnicek estas tesis han sido adoptadas por un grupo convergente de nuevas iniciativas progresistas, al mismo tiempo que vehementemente contestadas por sus críticos. Este rico intercambio, que intentamos reflejar en la presente antología, tuvo la virtud de reactivar y actualizar un campo histórico de tensiones cuyo eje es la relación entre los efectos alienantes de la tecnología y el sistema de valor capitalista. A la desesperanza dominante en la izquierda contemporánea, que se consuela con la estridente denuncia o con la creencia autocomplaciente de que mantener una adusta crítica desde el refugio de la teoría o la “indeterminación” del arte constituye resistencia, el aceleracionismo contrapone una imagen especulativa de otros futuros posibles y un mapa cognitivo para la identificación de aquellos elementos de este sistema que pueden ser eficaces en una transición a esa otra forma de vida. ¿Es posible concebir a la inteligencia artificial, la biotécnica y el dinero virtual como algo más que medios de producción optimizados para la obtención de rendimiento económico? ¿Y en qué podría convertirse el concepto mismo de lo “humano” si algunas de estas potencialidades latentes, tales como la abolición de la necesidad de trabajar o la crisis de las categorías esencialistas de identidad, fueran liberadas al interior de un nuevo socius postcapitalista? Se trata de un debate fundamental a la hora de abrir nuevas perspectivas para las aventuras sociales y políticas por venir.","author":[{"family":"Avanessian","given":"Armen"},{"family":"Reis","given":"Mauro."}],"citation-key":"Avanessian2017","ISBN":"978-987-1622-58-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"304","title":"Aceleracionismo: Estrategias para una transición hacia el postcapitalismo","type":"book","URL":"http://www.cajanegraeditora.com.ar/libros/aceleracionismo"},

The notion of temperament, which specially concerns instruments with fixed tones (but extends even on every music of any kind), constitutes a compromise between three fundamental requirements : pure intervals, free modulation and transposition, handy keyboards. First I recall the features of the most usual temperaments : mean tone, equal, irregular temperaments. I carry on my analysis with studying some temperaments remarkable for their ingenuity or exemplary because of their mistakes (Huygens, Sauveur in the first case, Henfling in the second one). Finally, people nostalgic of perfect intervals will be possibly satisfied with Helmholtz's harmonium in just intonation, an instrument puting an artful idea of the physicist in a concrete form.","author":[{"family":"Bailhache","given":"Patrice"}],"citation-key":"bailhacheTemperamentsMusicauxMathematiques","language":"fr","source":"Zotero","title":"Temperaments Musicaux Et Mathematiques","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"Ball2019","abstract":"Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.","author":[{"family":"Ball","given":"Philip"}],"citation-key":"Ball2019","container-title":"Hilos Tensados","ISBN":"9788578110796","ISSN":"1098-6596","issue":"-","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"page":"1–476","PMID":"25246403","title":"Shapes","type":"article-journal","volume":"1"},

  {"id":"banchetti-robinoChemicalPhilosophyRobert2020","abstract":"This book examines the way in which Robert Boyle seeks to accommodate his complex chemical philosophy within the framework of a mechanistic theory of matter. More specifically, the book proposes that Boyle regards chemical qualities as properties that emerged from the mechanistic structure of chymical atoms. Within Boyle's chemical ontology, chymical atoms are structured concretions of particles that Boyle regards as chemically elementary entities, that is, as chemical wholes that resist experimental analysis. Although this interpretation of Boyle's chemical philosophy has already been suggested by other Boyle scholars, the present book provides a sustained philosophical argument to demonstrate that, for Boyle, chemical properties are dispositional, relational, emergent, and supervenient properties. This argument is strengthened by a detailed mereological analysis of Boylean chymical atoms that establishes the kind of theory of wholes and parts that is most consistent with an emergentist conception of chemical properties. The emergentist position that is being attributed to Boyle supports his view that chemical reactions resist direct explanation in terms of the mechanistic properties of fundamental particles, as well as his position regarding the scientific autonomy of chymistry from mechanics and physics","author":[{"family":"Banchetti-Robino","given":"Marina Paola"}],"call-number":"540.1","citation-key":"banchetti-robinoChemicalPhilosophyRobert2020","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-0-19-750250-1 978-0-19-750252-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Oxford university press","publisher-place":"New York","source":"BnF ISBN","title":"The chemical philosophy of Robert Boyle: mechanicism, chymical atoms, and emergence","title-short":"The chemical philosophy of Robert Boyle","type":"book"},

  {"id":"baroniHyperinstrumentsInteractiveSystems2005","abstract":"Form shaping has been a principal focus of music composition since the mid XX Century, when the classical musical structures and listening practices started to be questioned by the avant-gardes. An advanced and pioneering system of composition was represented by Xenakis’s use of computers for elaborating scores from stochastic processes inspired by physical laws and complex mathematical behaviours; through non-linear mass distributions analogous forms were produced in macro-dimensions (orchestra) and micro-sounds (electronics). Starting from the 80s, a further development of this approach was based on the mapping of interactive actual human gestures onto pitched and synthetic sound contours [1]. More recently Godoy and Jensenius have been exploring cognitive and computational correspondences between human gestures and music, rooting their concept of music on the traditional electroacoustic idea of the sound-object as a primary building block [2]. A sound object is a gestural form-bearing perceptual unit, a fragment of concrete sound typically in the range of a few seconds, which can be seen as a structural counterpart of the more traditional element called “musical note”. The notion of gesture as a sensitive metaphor for the interpretation and analysis of music forms has become a consolidated topic over the last decades, blurring boundaries between score-based and electroacoustic composition. The current development of sensing systems, such as sound analysis in real-time and motion tracking, are supplying factual means for researching into the field of performance-based interactive music. Since their origin, the interactive behaviours of Hyper-instruments has been implemented as a means of empowering performers to intentionally influence the electroacoustic outputs of score-based compositions through their performance gestures on-stage [3]. Starting from the notion of interactivity we consider the potentials of the current sensing systems to be part of complex, digitally formalized, compositional networks and processes, in the light of the current emergence of embodied cognition frameworks. This paper explores topics bridging the meanings of music composition and music gesture, presenting as a conclusion some hypotheses which support innovative systems of performance based real-time digital composition implemented by the writer.","author":[{"family":"Baroni","given":"Nicola"}],"citation-key":"baroniHyperinstrumentsInteractiveSystems2005","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Hyperinstruments as interactive systems of music composition","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"barrettPORTFOLIOORIGINALCOMPOSITIONS","abstract":"The first half of this thesis begins from what for me are the four most significant innovations of twentieth century music: systematic composition methods, electronic and digital technology, free improvisation, and awareness of the historical, geographical and social dimensions of music. Possibilities for radicalising these areas are discussed, in the course of which several concepts central to my musical thinking, such as “radically idiomatic instrumentalism” and “seeded improvisation” are introduced. The second half focuses on the works submitted in the composition portfolio, both as practical explorations of the ideas discussed in the first half and as the environment in which those ideas originate and continue to evolve. These are world-line for electric lap steel guitar with trumpet, percussion and electronics, close-up for electroacoustic sextet, urlicht for percussion trio, eiszeiten for brass trio and electronics, and wake for three instrumental trios and electronics, all of which address from different directions the central issues of this research: the application to notated composition of concepts emerging from free improvisation, including highly systematic approaches, and an attempt to fuse the aforementioned innovations into a unified and coherent creative practice, in order to widen the way to future possibilities, and perhaps not only musical ones. .","author":[{"family":"Barrett","given":"Richard John"}],"citation-key":"barrettPORTFOLIOORIGINALCOMPOSITIONS","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Porfolio of Original Compositions","type":"thesis"},

Our study addresses these challenges by examining transparency in music generation. We conduct a systematic literature review, following the PRISMA methodology, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the associations between algorithmic transparency, music generation, the evaluation in terms of creativity and originality, and the connections to intellectual property rights. We identify 1,111 publications by formulating four research questions. Following a rigorous review process, we narrow down the selection to 66 relevant investigations published by 2022, covering multiple AI domains. Acknowledging the rapid growth of the music generation ﬁeld, we then incorporate 18 publications from 2023, focusing our search on the musicspeciﬁc domain and novel applications. Thus, the present review overviews 84 publications. Our ﬁndings highlight a growing interest in AI transparency and the ethical consequences of generative models. However, transparent strategies in music-generative AI remain an under-explored topic.

  {"id":"baudrillardSystemObjects2020","abstract":"The System of Objects is a tour de force--a theoretical letter-in-a-bottle tossed into the ocean in 1968, which brilliantly communicates to us all the live ideas of the day. Pressing Freudian and Saussurean categories into the service of a basically Marxist perspective, The System of Objects offers a cultural critique of the commodity in consumer society. Baudrillard classifies the everyday objects of the new technical order as functional, nonfunctional and metafunctional. He contrasts modern and traditional functional objects, subjecting home furnishing and interior design to a celebrated semiological analysis. His treatment of nonfunctional or marginal objects focuses on antiques and the psychology of collecting, while the metafunctional category extends to the useless, the aberrant and even the schizofunctional. Finally, Baudrillard deals at length with the implications of credit and advertising for the commodification of everyday life. The System of Objects is a tour de force of the materialist semiotics of the early Baudrillard, who emerges in retrospect as something of a lightning rod for all the live ideas of the day: Batailles political economy of expenditure and Mausss theory of the gift; Reismans lonely crowd and the technological society of Jacques Ellul; the structuralism of Roland Barthes in The System of Fashion; Henri Lefebvres work on the social construction of space; and last, but not least, Guy Debords situationist critique of the spectacle","author":[{"family":"Baudrillard","given":"Jean"}],"citation-key":"baudrillardSystemObjects2020","event-place":"S.l.","ISBN":"978-1-78873-943-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"eng","note":"OCLC: 1473633467","publisher":"Verso Books","publisher-place":"S.l.","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"The System of Objects","type":"book"},

The key to these sonic strategies involves creating \"boom moments\" -- transcendent instants when sound connects with a listener's emotional core. The Sonic Boom draws surprising insights from real world examples: the way Disney parks score every second of their guests' experience; how Chili's restaurants uses lessons from evolutionary psychology to sell tons of sizzling fajitas, how the sound of a special edition Mustang's engine is designed to make drivers feel like action-movie heroes.

  {"id":"bellemareArcadeLearningEnvironment2013","abstract":"In this article we introduce the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE): both a challenge problem and a platform and methodology for evaluating the development of general, domain-independent AI technology. ALE provides an interface to hundreds of Atari 2600 game environments, each one different, interesting, and designed to be a challenge for human players. ALE presents significant research challenges for reinforcement learning, model learning, model-based planning, imitation learning, transfer learning, and intrinsic motivation. Most importantly, it provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating and comparing approaches to these problems. We illustrate the promise of ALE by developing and benchmarking domain-independent agents designed using well-established AI techniques for both reinforcement learning and planning. In doing so, we also propose an evaluation methodology made possible by ALE, reporting empirical results on over 55 different games. All of the software, including the benchmark agents, is publicly available.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Bellemare","given":"Marc G."},{"family":"Naddaf","given":"Yavar"},{"family":"Veness","given":"Joel"},{"family":"Bowling","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"bellemareArcadeLearningEnvironment2013","container-title":"Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research","container-title-short":"jair","DOI":"10.1613/jair.3912","ISSN":"1076-9757","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",6,14]]},"note":"TLDR: The promise of ALE is illustrated by developing and benchmarking domain-independent agents designed using well-established AI techniques for both reinforcement learning and planning, and an evaluation methodology made possible by ALE is proposed.","page":"253-279","source":"arXiv.org","title":"The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents","title-short":"The Arcade Learning Environment","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.4708","volume":"47"},

  {"id":"Ben-Amots1993","abstract":"This important new study reassesses the position of Anton Webern in twentieth-century music. The twelve-note method of composition adopted by Anton Webern had profound consequences for composers of the next generation such as Stockhausen and Boulez, who saw Webern's music as revolutionary. In her detailed analyses, however, Professor Bailey demonstrates a fundamentally traditional aspect to Webern's creativity, when describing his own music. Professor Bailey analyses all Webern's twelve-note works (from Op. 17 to Op. 31) i.e. the instrumental and vocal music written between 1924 and 1943. These analyses draw on sketch material recently made available at the Paul Sacher Foundation in Basel and include transcriptions of little-known drafts and sketches. A most valuable aspect of the book is the inclusion in appendices of such materials as a complete explanation of the row content of each work, the correct prime form of each of the rows from Op. 20 onwards, with a matrix constructed for each, and exhaustive row analyses.","author":[{"family":"Ben-Amots","given":"Ofer"},{"family":"Bailey","given":"Kathryn"},{"family":"Essl","given":"Karlheinz"}],"citation-key":"Ben-Amots1993","container-title":"Notes","DOI":"10.2307/898965","ISBN":"978-0-521-39088-0","ISSN":"00274380","issued":{"date-parts":[["1993"]]},"number":"3","page":"1035","title":"The twelve-note music of anton webern: Old forms in a new language","type":"chapter","volume":"49"},

  {"id":"bernardoDesigningEvaluatingUsability2020","abstract":"To better support creative software developers and music technologists’ needs, and to empower them as machine learning users and innovators, the usability of and developer experience with machine learning tools must be considered and better understood. We review background research on the design and evaluation of application programming interfaces (APIs), with a focus on the domain of machine learning for music technology software development. We present the design rationale for the RAPID-MIX API, an easy-to-use API for rapid prototyping with interactive machine learning, and a usability evaluation study with software developers of music technology. A cognitive dimensions questionnaire was designed and delivered to a group of 12 participants who used the RAPID-MIX API in their software projects, including people who developed systems for personal use and professionals developing software products for music and creative technology companies. The results from questionnaire indicate that participants found the RAPID-MIX API a machine learning API which is easy to learn and use, fun, and good for rapid prototyping with interactive machine learning. Based on these ﬁndings, we present an analysis and characterization of the RAPID-MIX API based on the cognitive dimensions framework, and discuss its design trade-offs and usability issues. We use these insights and our design experience to provide design recommendations for ML APIs for rapid prototyping of music technology. We conclude with a summary of the main insights, a discussion of the merits and challenges of the application of the CDs framework to the evaluation of machine learning APIs, and directions to future work which our research deems valuable.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Bernardo","given":"Francisco"},{"family":"Zbyszyński","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Grierson","given":"Mick"},{"family":"Fiebrink","given":"Rebecca"}],"citation-key":"bernardoDesigningEvaluatingUsability2020","container-title":"Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence","container-title-short":"Front.

Among his broad intermedial interests opera has always held a central place. For the first time this volume makes available his major contributions to opera criticism in compact form, thus meeting a serious scholarly demand. The necessarily stringent selection of essays from Professor Weisstein's large output on opera, reflecting fifty years of involvement with the genre, is primarily governed by the wish to present texts that are representative of their author's work and, at the same time, are unlikely to be readily available through other channels. The fourteen essays collected are arranged in chronological order, some of them showing Ulrich Weisstein as an initiator of librettology, others tracing adaptive processes extending from textual sources to final operas, or investigating writer/composer collaborations. Further topics are satirical reflections on operatic activities in early-eighteenth-century Italy and practices of opera censorship, artist operas or definitions of romantic and epic opera.

  {"id":"berovNarratologyComputationalStory2023","abstract":"There are two disciplines that are concerened with the same object of study, narratives, but that rarely exchange insights and ideas, let alone engage in collaborative research. The first is Narrative Theory (NT), an analytical discipline from the humanities that attempts to analyze literary texts and from these instances derive a general understanding of the concept of narrative. The second is Compuatational Story Composition (CSC), a discipline in the domain of Artificial Intelligence that attempts to enable computers to autonomously compose fictional narratives in a way that could be deemed creative. Several reasons can be found for the lack of collaboration, but one of them stands out: The two disciplines follow decidedly different research methodologies at contradistinct levels of abstraction. This makes it hard to conduct NT and CSC research simultaneously, and also means that CSC researchers have a hard time validating whether they use NT concepts correctly, while NT scholars have no use for the outputs created by work in CSC. At the same time, a close exchance between the two disciplines would be desirebale, not only because of the complementary approach to their object of study, but also because comparable interdisciplinary collaborations have proven to be productive in other fields, like for instance linguistics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Berov","given":"Leonid"}],"citation-key":"berovNarratologyComputationalStory2023","collection-title":"Dissertations in Artificial Intelligence","DOI":"10.3233/DAI353","ISBN":"978-1-64368-382-9 978-1-64368-383-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,23]]},"language":"en","publisher":"IOS Press","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"From Narratology to Computational Story Composition and Back: An Exploratory Study in Generative Modeling","title-short":"From Narratology to Computational Story Composition and Back","type":"book","URL":"https://ebooks.iospress.nl/doi/10.3233/DAI353","volume":"353"},
  {"id":"berthautLivenessLensAgency2015","abstract":"Liveness is a well-known problem with Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs). When used in performances, DMIs provide less visual information than acoustic instruments, preventing the audience from understanding how the musicians inﬂuence the music. In this paper, we look at this issue through the lens of causality. More speciﬁcally, we investigate the attribution of causality by an external observer to a performer, relying on the theory of apparent mental causation. We suggest that the perceived causality between a performer’s gestures and the musical result is central to liveness. We present a framework for assessing attributed causality and agency to a performer, based on a psychological theory which suggests three criteria for inferred causality. These criteria then provide the basis of an experimental study investigating the eﬀect of visual augmentations on audience’s inferred causality. The results provide insights on how the visual component of performances with DMIs impacts the audience’s causal inferences about the performer.

  {"id":"bhagwatiMusickingBodyElectric2016","abstract":"Situational scores, in this paper, are defined as scores that deliver time- and context-sensitive score information to musicians at the moment when it becomes relevant. Mnemonic (rule/style-based) scores are the oldest score models of this type. Lately, reactive, interactive, locative scores have added new options to situative scoring. The body:suit:score is an interface currently developed in collaboration of four labs at Concordia and McGill Universities in Montréal - an interface that will allow the musical use of all four types of situational score. Musicians are clad in a body-hugging suit with embedded technology - this suit becomes their score interface. Ultimately intended to enable ensembles to move through performance spaces unencumbered by visual scores and their specific locations, the project currently enters its second year of research-creation. The paper discusses the closely intertwined technological, ergonomic, performance-psychology-based and artistic decisions that have led to a first bodysuit prototype - a vibrotactile suit for a solo musician. It will also discuss three etude compositions by Sandeep Bhagwati and Julian Klein for this prototype, and their conceptual approaches to an artistic use of the body:suit:score interface. Finally, the paper discusses next steps and emergent problems and opportunities, both technological and artistic.","author":[{"family":"Bhagwati","given":"Sandeep"},{"family":"Cossette","given":"Isabelle"},{"family":"Berzowska","given":"Joanna"},{"family":"Basanta","given":"Adam"},{"family":"Stein","given":"Julian"},{"family":"Browne","given":"Joseph"},{"family":"Bachmayer","given":"Alexandra"},{"family":"Tredici","given":"Felix Del"},{"family":"Albu","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Giordano","given":"Marcello"},{"family":"Sullivan","given":"John"},{"family":"Egloff","given":"Deborah"},{"family":"Wanderley","given":"Marcelo"},{"family":"Klein","given":"Julian"}],"citation-key":"bhagwatiMusickingBodyElectric2016","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Musicking the Body Electric","type":"article-journal"},

To explore the future impact and potential of AI in the ﬁeld of music and sound technologies a doctoral day was held between Queen Mary University of London (QMUL, UK) and Sciences et Technologies de la Musique et du Son (STMS, France). Prompt questions about current trends in AI and music were generated by academics from QMUL and STMS. Students from the two institutions then debated these questions. This report presents a summary of the student debates on the topics of: Data, Impact, and the Environment; Responsible Innovation and Creative Practice; Creativity and Bias; and From Tools to the Singularity. The students represent the future generation of AI and music researchers. The academics represent the incumbent establishment. The student debates reported here capture visions, dreams, concerns, uncertainties, and contentious issues for the future of AI and music as the establishment is rightfully challenged by the next generation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Bindi","given":"Giovanni"},{"family":"Demerlé","given":"Nils"},{"family":"Diaz","given":"Rodrigo"},{"family":"Genova","given":"David"},{"family":"Golvet","given":"Aliénor"},{"family":"Hayes","given":"Ben"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Jiawen"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Lele"},{"family":"Martos","given":"Vincent"},{"family":"Nabi","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Pelinski","given":"Teresa"},{"family":"Renault","given":"Lenny"},{"family":"Sarkar","given":"Saurjya"},{"family":"Sarmento","given":"Pedro"},{"family":"Vahidi","given":"Cyrus"},{"family":"Wolstanholme","given":"Lewis"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yixiao"},{"family":"Roebel","given":"Axel"},{"family":"Bryan-Kinns","given":"Nick"},{"family":"Giavitto","given":"Jean-Louis"},{"family":"Barthet","given":"Mathieu"}],"citation-key":"bindiAIRevolutionWhere2023","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2310.18320","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,20]]},"language":"en","number":"arXiv:2310.18320","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"AI (r)evolution -- where are we heading?

Performative, improvised, on the fly: live coding is about how people interact with the world and each other via code. In the last few decades, live coding has emerged as a dynamic creative practice, gaining attention across cultural and technical fields—from music and the visual arts to computer science. Live Coding: A User's Manual is the first comprehensive introduction to the practice and a broader cultural commentary on the potential for live coding to open up deeper questions about contemporary cultural production and computational culture. This multiauthored book—by artists and musicians, software designers, and researchers—provides a practice-focused account of the origins, aspirations, and evolution of live coding, including expositions from a wide range of live coding practitioners. In a more conceptual register, the authors consider liveness, temporality, and knowledge in relation to live coding, alongside speculating on the practice's future forms.

The hyperproduction system is able to interpret this universal state and automatically utilize additional production systems, allowing for a small number of producers to cohesively guide the attention and perspective of an audience using many or very complex production systems simultaneously. The work focuses on exploring the relationship of conventional production systems and techniques to abstract computational models of live performance. The conceptual framework will identify key elements of an effective model in each case, with attention and perspective as the cornerstones of this exploration. Several examples of hyperproduction systems will be constructed and evaluated in a variety of live experiences, including sound-only performance, live broadcast, and remote interactive audience extension.","author":[{"family":"Bloomberg","given":"Benjamin A"}],"citation-key":"bloombergHyperproductionAudiocentricFramework2014","DOI":"903655268","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Hyperproduction: an audio-centric framework for the abstract modeling of live performance to guide audience attention and perspective using connected real-time systems","type":"article-journal"},

Questa la nota \"cornice\" che racchiude la più celebre raccolta di novelle della letteratura europea: un capolavoro che ancora affascina per la pluralità dei toni, per la capacità di dipingere l'infinita varietà della vita. Per i settecento anni dalla nascita di Boccaccio, i massimi esperti italiani della sua opera danno vita a un'edizione innovativa, fondante di una nuova tradizione interpretativa, in cui il massimo rigore filologico è associato a una inedita apertura verso i lettori d'oggi. Il nuovo testo critico stabilito da Maurizio Fiorilla è preceduto dalla rigorosa e appassionata introduzione di Amedeo Quondam, cui si deve anche il ricchissimo apparato di note; le introduzioni alle singole giornate di Giancarlo Alfano approfondiscono i rapporti che legano tra loro le novelle.","author":[{"family":"Boccaccio","given":"Giovanni"},{"family":"Quondam","given":"Amedeo"},{"family":"Fiorilla","given":"Maurizio"},{"family":"Alfano","given":"Giancarlo"}],"citation-key":"boccaccioDecameron2013a","ISBN":"978-88-586-4441-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"language":"IT","license":"Copyright © 2013 RCS Libri S.p.A., Milano","note":"Item ID: _:n1","publisher":"BUR","title":"Decameron","type":"book"},

  {"id":"bohringerQuantificationFacialTraits2019","abstract":"Measuring facial traits by quantitative means is a prerequisite to investigate epidemiological, clinical, and forensic questions. This measurement process has received intense attention in recent years. We divided this process into the registration of the face, landmarking, morphometric quantiﬁcation, and dimension reduction. Face registration is the process of standardizing pose and landmarking annotates positions in the face with anatomic description or mathematically deﬁned properties (pseudolandmarks). Morphometric quantiﬁcation computes pre-speciﬁed transformations such as distances. Landmarking: We review face registration methods which are required by some landmarking methods. Although similar, face registration and landmarking are distinct problems. The registration phase can be seen as a pre-processing step and can be combined independently with a landmarking solution. Existing approaches for landmarking differ in their data requirements, modeling approach, and training complexity. In this review, we focus on 3D surface data as captured by commercial surface scanners but also cover methods for 2D facial pictures, when methodology overlaps. We discuss the broad categories of active shape models, template based approaches, recent deep-learning algorithms, and variations thereof such as hybrid algorithms. The type of algorithm chosen depends on the availability of pre-trained models for the data at hand, availability of an appropriate landmark set, accuracy characteristics, and training complexity. Quantiﬁcation: Landmarking of anatomical landmarks is usually augmented by pseudo-landmarks, i.e., indirectly deﬁned landmarks that densely cover the scan surface. Such a rich data set is not amenable to direct analysis but is reduced in dimensionality for downstream analysis. We review classic dimension reduction techniques used for facial data and face speciﬁc measures, such as geometric measurements and manifold learning. Finally, we review symmetry registration and discuss reliability.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Böhringer","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"De Jong","given":"Markus A."}],"citation-key":"bohringerQuantificationFacialTraits2019","container-title":"Frontiers in Genetics","container-title-short":"Front.

  {"id":"bornMusicDigitalMedia2022","abstract":"Anthropology has neglected the study of music. Music and Digital Media shows how and why this should be redressed. It does so by enabling music to expand the horizons of digital anthropology, demonstrating how the field can build interdisciplinary links to music and sound studies, digital/media studies, and science and technology studies.  Music and Digital Media is the first comparative ethnographic study of the impact of digital media on music worldwide. It offers a radical and lucid new theoretical framework for understanding digital media through music, showing that music is today where the promises and problems of the digital assume clamouring audibility. The book contains ten chapters, eight of which present comprehensive original ethnographies; they are bookended by an authoritative introduction and a comparative postlude. Five chapters address popular, folk, art and crossover musics in the global South and North, including Kenya, Argentina, India, Canada and the UK. Three chapters bring the digital experimentally to the fore, presenting pioneering ethnographies of an extra-legal peer-to-peer site and the streaming platform Spotify, a series of prominent internet-mediated music genres, and the first ethnography of a global software package, the interactive music platform Max.  The book is unique in bringing ethnographic research on popular, folk, art and crossover musics from the global North and South into a comparative framework on a large scale, and creates an innovative new paradigm for comparative anthropology. It shows how music enlarges anthropology while demanding to be understood with reference to classic themes of anthropological theory.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,6]]},"citation-key":"bornMusicDigitalMedia2022","DOI":"10.14324/111.9781800082434","editor":[{"family":"Born","given":"Georgina"}],"ISBN":"978-1-80008-243-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,12]]},"language":"en","publisher":"UCL Press","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Music and Digital Media: A planetary anthology","title-short":"Music and Digital Media","type":"book","URL":"https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10155196/"},

  {"id":"Bowie2007","abstract":"Modern philosophers generally assume that music is a problem to which philosophy ought to offer an answer. Andrew Bowie's Music, Philosophy, and Modernity suggests, in contrast, that music might offer ways of responding to some central questions in modern philosophy. Bowie looks at key philosophical approaches to music ranging from Kant, through the German Romantics and Wagner, to Wittgenstein, Heidegger and Adorno. He uses music to re-examine many ideas about language, subjectivity, metaphysics, truth and ethics, and he suggests that music can show how the predominant images of language, communication, and meaning in contemporary philosophy may be lacking in essential ways. His book will be of interest to philosophers, musicologists, and all who are interested in the relation between music and philosophy.","author":[{"family":"Bowie","given":"Andrew"}],"citation-key":"Bowie2007","container-title":"Music, philosophy, and modernity","DOI":"10.1017/CBO9780511487569","ISBN":"978-0-511-48756-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007"]]},"page":"1–428","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Music, philosophy, and modernity","type":"chapter"},

My first efforts on this book took place in Paris in September 1973 as a means to challenge what I felt to be deliberate misinformation about black creativity and black creative dynamics ...

Our news feeds are filled with unverified, unverifiable speculation, much of it automatically generated by anonymous software. As a result, we no longer understand what is happening around us.

Yet the sheer volume of information available to us today reveals less than we hope. Rather it heralds a new Dark Age: a world of ever-increasing incomprehension. In his brilliant new work, leading artist and writer James Bridle offers us a warning against the future in which the contemporary promise of a new technologically assisted enlightenment may just deliver its opposite: an age of complex uncertainty, predictive algorithms, surveillance, the hollowing out of empathy.

Beginning with a wholesale rethinking of the affect of horror, orienting it away from entrenched models of feeling toward impersonal schemes and structures, Brinkema moves outward to consider the relation between objects and affects, humiliation and metaphysics, genre and the general, bodily destruction and aesthetic generation, geometry and scenography, hatred and value, love and measurement, and, ultimately, the tensions, hazards, and speculative promise of formalism itself.

A growing area of application is the generation of creative content, notably the case of music, the topic of this paper. The motivation is in using the capacity of modern deep learning techniques to automatically learn musical styles from arbitrary musical corpora and then to generate musical samples from the estimated distribution, with some degree of control over the generation. This paper provides a tutorial on music generation based on deep learning techniques. After a short introduction to the topic illustrated by a recent exemple, the paper analyzes some early works from the late 1980s using artiﬁcial neural networks for music generation and how their pioneering contributions have preﬁgured current techniques. Then, we introduce some conceptual framework to analyze the various concepts and dimensions involved. Various examples of recent systems are introduced and analyzed to illustrate the variety of concerns and of techniques.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Briot","given":"Jean-Pierre"}],"citation-key":"briotArtificialNeuralNetworks2020","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2004.03586","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,5]]},"language":"en","number":"arXiv:2004.03586","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"From Artificial Neural Networks to Deep Learning for Music Generation -- History, Concepts and Trends","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03586"},

  {"id":"Broad2013","abstract":"One of the foremost composers of the twentieth century, Olivier Messiaen wrote widely on his music and on his beliefs. This is the first edition of his early journalism and provides both the original French text and an English translation. The writing in this volume dates from the 1930s, before the composer gained the international reputation that he and his music now enjoy. The pieces he wrote range from reviews of individual performances to essays on particular works or composers and articles that discuss more general themes such as sincerity of expression in music. Many of the articles included in this collection are new to the Messiaen bibliography, and others are available here for the first time in English. A number are, as Broad describes them, ‘quietly shocking' in that they force us to reappraise certain aspects of the composer such as his role in La Jeune France, and his wider participation in the debates of his time. This edition, therefore, represents a new source for understanding Messiaen and provides a fascinating glimpse of the composer in the early part of his career.","author":[{"family":"Broad","given":"Stephen"}],"citation-key":"Broad2013","container-title":"Olivier messiaen: Journalism 1935-1939","DOI":"10.4324/9781315598802","ISBN":"978-1-4094-4477-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"page":"1–169","title":"Olivier messiaen: Journalism 1935-1939","type":"chapter"},

  {"id":"Bryant2016","abstract":"Continental philosophy has entered a new period of ferment. The long deconstructionist era was followed with a period dominated by Deleuze; which has in turn evolved into a new situation still difficult to define. However; one common thread running through the new brand of continental positions is a renewed attention to materialist and realist options in philosophy. Among the leaders of the established generation; this new focus takes numerous forms. It might be hard to find many shared positions in the writings of Badiou; DeLanda; Laruelle; Latour; Stengers; and Žižek; but what is missing from their positions is an obsession with the critique of written texts. All of them elaborate a positive ontology; despite the incompatibility of their results. Meanwhile; the new generation of continental thinkers is pushing these trends still further; as seen in currents ranging from transcendental materialism to the London-based speculative realism movement to new revivals of Derrida. As indicated by the title The Speculative Turn; the new currents of continental philosophy depart from the text-centered hermeneutic models of the past and engage in daring speculations about the nature of reality itself. This anthology assembles authors; of several generations and numerous nationalities; who will be at the centre of debate in continental philosophy for decades to come.","author":[{"family":"Bryant","given":"Levi"},{"family":"Srnicek","given":"Nick"},{"family":"Harman","given":"Graham"},{"family":"Catren","given":"Gabriel"}],"citation-key":"Bryant2016","container-title":"Spirale : arts • lettres • sciences humaines","ISBN":"978-0-9806683-4-6","ISSN":"1923-3213","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"number":"255","page":"45–47","title":"The speculative turn: Continental realism and materialism","type":"chapter"},

  {"id":"bubeckSparksArtificialGeneral2023","abstract":"Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) researchers have been developing and reﬁning large language models (LLMs) that exhibit remarkable capabilities across a variety of domains and tasks, challenging our understanding of learning and cognition. The latest model developed by OpenAI, GPT-4 [Ope23], was trained using an unprecedented scale of compute and data. In this paper, we report on our investigation of an early version of GPT-4, when it was still in active development by OpenAI. We contend that (this early version of) GPT4 is part of a new cohort of LLMs (along with ChatGPT and Google’s PaLM for example) that exhibit more general intelligence than previous AI models. We discuss the rising capabilities and implications of these models. We demonstrate that, beyond its mastery of language, GPT-4 can solve novel and diﬃcult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without needing any special prompting. Moreover, in all of these tasks, GPT-4’s performance is strikingly close to human-level performance, and often vastly surpasses prior models such as ChatGPT. Given the breadth and depth of GPT-4’s capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artiﬁcial general intelligence (AGI) system. In our exploration of GPT-4, we put special emphasis on discovering its limitations, and we discuss the challenges ahead for advancing towards deeper and more comprehensive versions of AGI, including the possible need for pursuing a new paradigm that moves beyond next-word prediction. We conclude with reﬂections on societal inﬂuences of the recent technological leap and future research directions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Bubeck","given":"Sébastien"},{"family":"Chandrasekaran","given":"Varun"},{"family":"Eldan","given":"Ronen"},{"family":"Gehrke","given":"Johannes"},{"family":"Horvitz","given":"Eric"},{"family":"Kamar","given":"Ece"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Yin Tat"},{"family":"Li","given":"Yuanzhi"},{"family":"Lundberg","given":"Scott"},{"family":"Nori","given":"Harsha"},{"family":"Palangi","given":"Hamid"},{"family":"Ribeiro","given":"Marco Tulio"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yi"}],"citation-key":"bubeckSparksArtificialGeneral2023","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,13]]},"language":"en","number":"arXiv:2303.12712","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence: Early experiments with GPT-4","title-short":"Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12712"},

Many of the works create and explore relationships between sound and video, reflecting a concern with the multi-modal nature of perception. In most of these compositions, material is structured by simple algorithmic processes. Tese processes are used to explore relationships between perception and cognition: how the changing form of a work over time reveals the nature of a process to us, and how our understanding of that process affects our expectation and anticipation of future form. One work in the folio takes the approach of transforming existing sound and image. Tis process is used in an attempt to disrupt 'musical meaning' and other symbolic content encoded in the source material. These compositions were completed between 2009 and 2012 and are presented chronologically, demonstrating the progression of my ideas throughout this period.

  {"id":"cacheiroPosthumanWorldsRoberto2022","abstract":"Posthuman Worlds: Roberto Bolaño's Narrative and Virtual Reality presents interpretations of several novels and one short story by Roberto Bolaño. As befits the global setting of most of these narratives, they are analyzed from the perspective of global culture and politics. Particular attention is paid to transnational European politics, as this topic is central to an understanding of the intertwined themes of politics and the law in Bolaño’s work. In Distant Star and “Labyrinth,” these themes exist within the context of a preoccupation with personal identity and ideology. Adolfo Cacheiro utilizes psychoanalytic interpretation and philosophical exegesis to clarify the subjective component of this preoccupation in the aforementioned texts. The law is also a prominent theme of The Savage Detectives, which Cacheiro interprets in relation to mythology. One of the most innovative aspects of this book is the discussion of the role of virtual reality in Amulet and 2666. These novels are read as representations of a posthuman world that manifest an intertextual relationship with science fiction. In 2666 virtual reality unifies the diverse components of a world system in time and space. A phenomenological investigation of this reality supports the conclusion that the principle subject matter of 2666 is a naturalistic theology based on technology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Cacheiro","given":"Adolfo"}],"citation-key":"cacheiroPosthumanWorldsRoberto2022","DOI":"10.5771/9781793649881","ISBN":"978-1-7936-4988-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Lexington Books","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Posthuman Worlds: Roberto Bolaño's Narrative and Virtual Reality","title-short":"Posthuman Worlds","type":"book","URL":"https://www.nomos-elibrary.de/index.php?doi=10.5771/9781793649881"},
  {"id":"cadozMusicalCreationProcess2014","abstract":"Considering artistic creation as an emblematic enactive process and the artistic creation process as deeply linked with technology, we propose a conceptual framework allowing to give signification to the concept of artistic creation tool in the context of digital technology. We start from a very simple (theoretical) situation, which is a kind of primordial musical instrumental experience where we characterize the main phases of the creation process under an enactive point of view. Then, we discuss briefly some needs to which technology evolution brought certain solutions and the new functionalities it introduced. After that, entering in the “new technology” era we show in what the introduction of the digital technology in the field of artistic creation is not simply an evolution but, though not yet accomplished, a deep revolution. Finally, through a brief presentation of our own research and its correlated musical creation activity in the laboratory, we introduce two important concepts: the first concerns the use of the mass-interaction physical modeling paradigm for the musical macrostructure creation, the second, closely related, is that of “SupraInstrumental Gesture”. Both correspond, in the case of musical creation, to an extension of the enaction point of view from the multisensory-motricity level to the scale of musical composition.","author":[{"family":"Cadoz","given":"Claude"}],"citation-key":"cadozMusicalCreationProcess2014","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Musical Creation Process and Digital Technology: ''the Supra-Instrumental Gesture''","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"caillonRAVEVariationalAutoencoder2021","abstract":"Deep generative models applied to audio have improved by a large margin the state-of-the-art in many speech and music related tasks. However, as raw waveform modelling remains an inherently difﬁcult task, audio generative models are either computationally intensive, rely on low sampling rates, are complicated to control or restrict the nature of possible signals. Among those models, Variational AutoEncoders (VAE) give control over the generation by exposing latent variables, although they usually suffer from low synthesis quality. In this paper, we introduce a Realtime Audio Variational autoEncoder (RAVE) allowing both fast and high-quality audio waveform synthesis. We introduce a novel two-stage training procedure, namely representation learning and adversarial ﬁne-tuning. We show that using a post-training analysis of the latent space allows a direct control between the reconstruction ﬁdelity and the representation compactness. By leveraging a multi-band decomposition of the raw waveform, we show that our model is the ﬁrst able to generate 48kHz audio signals, while simultaneously running 20 times faster than real-time on a standard laptop CPU. We evaluate synthesis quality using both quantitative and qualitative subjective experiments and show the superiority of our approach compared to existing models. Finally, we present applications of our model for timbre transfer and signal compression. All of our source code and audio examples are publicly available.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Caillon","given":"Antoine"},{"family":"Esling","given":"Philippe"}],"citation-key":"caillonRAVEVariationalAutoencoder2021","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2111.05011","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,15]]},"language":"en","number":"arXiv:2111.05011","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"RAVE: A variational autoencoder for fast and high-quality neural audio synthesis","title-short":"RAVE","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05011"},

  {"id":"campagnaTechnicMagicReconstruction2018","abstract":"We take for granted that only certain kind of things exist - electrons but not angels, passports but not nymphs. This is what we understand as `reality'. But in fact, `reality' varies with each era of the world, in turn shaping the field of what is possible to do, think and imagine. Our contemporary age has embraced a troubling and painful form of reality: Technic. Under Technic, the foundations of reality begin to crumble, shrinking the field of the possible and freezing our lives in an anguished state of paralysis. Technic and Magic shows that the way out of the present deadlock lies much deeper than debates on politics or economics. By drawing from an array of Northern and Southern sources - spanning from Heidegger, Junger and Stirner's philosophies, through Pessoa's poetry, to Advaita Vedanta, Bhartrhari, Ibn Arabi, Suhrawardi and Mulla Sadra's theosophies - Magic is presented as an alternative system of reality to Technic. While Technic attempts to capture the world through an `absolute language', Magic centres its reconstruction of the world around the notion of the `ineffable' that lies at the heart of existence. Technic and Magic is an original philosophical work, and a timely cultural intervention. It disturbs our understanding of the structure of reality, while restoring it in a new form.

  {"id":"campanteAdvancedMacroeconomicsEasy2021","abstract":"Macroeconomic policy is one of the most important policy domains, and the tools of macroeconomics are among the most valuable for policy makers. Yet there has been, up to now, a wide gulf between the level at which macroeconomics is taught at the undergraduate level and the level at which it is practiced. At the same time, doctoral-level textbooks are usually not targeted at a policy audience, making advanced macroeconomics less accessible to current and aspiring practitioners.  This book, born out of the Masters course the authors taught for many years at the Harvard Kennedy School, fills this gap. It introduces the tools of dynamic optimization in the context of economic growth, and then applies them to a wide range of policy questions – ranging from pensions, consumption, investment and finance, to the most recent developments in fiscal and monetary policy. It does so with the requisite rigor, but also with a light touch, and an unyielding focus on their application to policy-making, as befits the authors’ own practical experience.

We modify the traditional SIR model of disease spread by incorporating infectious recovery dynamics such that contact between a recovered and infected member of the population is required for recovery. The proposed infectious recovery SIR model (irSIR model) is validated using publicly available Google search query data for “MySpace” as a case study of an OSN that has exhibited both adoption and abandonment phases. The irSIR model is then applied to search query data for “Facebook,” which is just beginning to show the onset of an abandonment phase.

  {"id":"capraAugmentedFamiliarityAudience2018","abstract":"The diversity and complexity of Digital Musical Instruments often lead to a reduced appreciation of live performances by the audience. This can be linked to the lack of familiarity they have with the instruments. We propose to increase this familiarity thanks to a transdisciplinary approach in which signals from both the musician and the audience are extracted, familiarity analyzed, and augmentations dynamically added to the instruments. We introduce a new decomposition of familiarity and the concept of correspondences between musical gestures and results. This paper is both a review of research that paves the way for the realization of a pipeline for augmented familiarity, and a call for future research on the identiﬁed challenges that remain before it can be implemented.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Capra","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Berthaut","given":"Florent"},{"family":"Grisoni","given":"Laurent"}],"citation-key":"capraAugmentedFamiliarityAudience2018","container-title":"Music Technology with Swing","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-030-01692-0_37","editor":[{"family":"Aramaki","given":"Mitsuko"},{"family":"Davies","given":"Matthew E.

Because interaction with sound may be task oriented or experience-based it is important to understand the nature of action-sound relationships in order to design rich sonic interactions. We propose a participatory approach to sonic interaction design that first considers the affordances of sounds in order to imagine embodied interaction, and based on this, generates interaction models for interaction designers wishing to work with sound. We describe a series of workshops, called Form Follows Sound, where participants ideate imagined sonic interactions, and then realize working interactive sound prototypes. We introduce the Sonic Incident technique, as a way to recall memorable sound experiences. We identified three interaction models for sonic interaction design: conducting; manipulating; substituting. These three interaction models offer interaction designers and developers a framework on which they can build richer sonic interactions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Caramiaux","given":"Baptiste"},{"family":"Altavilla","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Pobiner","given":"Scott G."},{"family":"Tanaka","given":"Atau"}],"citation-key":"caramiauxFormFollowsSound2015","container-title":"Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","DOI":"10.1145/2702123.2702515","event-place":"Seoul Republic of Korea","event-title":"CHI '15: CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","ISBN":"978-1-4503-3145-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",4,18]]},"language":"en","page":"3943-3952","publisher":"ACM","publisher-place":"Seoul Republic of Korea","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Form Follows Sound: Designing Interactions from Sonic Memories","title-short":"Form Follows Sound","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2702123.2702515"},

In the ﬁrst workshop, we posed two leading questions to participants. First, what can AI and robotics learn by how improvisers think about time, space, actions, and decisions? Second, how can improvisation and musical instruments be enhanced by AI and robotics? The workshop included sessions led by the musicians, which provided an overview of the theory and practice of musical improvisation. In other sessions, AI and robotics researchers introduced AI principles to the musicians. Two smaller follow-up workshops comprised of only engineering and information science students provided an opportunity to elaborate on the principles covered in the ﬁrst workshop. The workshops revealed parallels and discrepancies in the conceptualization of improvisation between musicians and engineers.

Optimism. Stammer. Old Books. Hume.\" In truth, his life contained even more. Years earlier, as a young Cambridge philosopher and economist, Keynes spent his days moving between government service and academia, and when he was called up to the Treasury on the eve of World War I, he relished an opportunity to save the empire. He worked dutifully, but as the aftermath of the war and the disastrous Versailles Treaty unfolded, with its harsh demands for German reparations, Keynes saw how the strain on its citizens might encourage would-be authoritarians. The experience began a career that spanned two world wars and a global depression and which often found him in a Cassandra-like position, arguing against widely accepted ideas that he saw as outdated or dangerous. His influential ideas made it to America and FDR's New Deal in the Great Depression, and through his books, especially The General Theory, he became a founding giant in the economics profession. Even as his star rose, however, the most important allegiance of Keynes's life was to writers and artists. He valued his membership in the iconic Bloomsbury Group above any position, and he forever envied the talents of his friends like Virginia Woolf and Lytton Strachey, often providing them with much needed financial support as the most gainfully employed member of the group.

Notions of speed, duration, and pulse are all dependent upon secondary, ﬁxed reference points, a Euclidean grid sitting explicitly or implicitly behind the rhythms of the sounds we hear on the surface. It is a rhythm that is always about counting. This lecture explores a rhythm that eschews counting, that engages with speed and duration as primary rather than secondary phenomena, and that emerges through the interface between movement and resistance and from models of force, viscosity, and friction. We will examine some of the limitations of existing rhythmic notation and, using examples from a current composition project entitled The Wreck of Former Boundaries as well as several case studies from non-notated musical traditions, a few alternatives for ‘non-geometrical’ notational approaches will be proposed.","author":[{"family":"Cassidy","given":"Aaron"}],"citation-key":"cassidyImaginingNonGeometricalRhythm2015","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Imagining a Non-Geometrical Rhythm","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"castellanosCoevolutionNeocyberneticEmergence2016","abstract":"Abstract\n            This article provides an overview of research into how certain forms of interactive art, what I call the ‘emergent arts’, facilitate or amplify a construction of a reality that is active, dynamic, collaborative and co-evolutionary with our increasingly technologized environment. By examining these artworks and experiences via the interlocking frames of cybernetics, phenomenology and posthumanist thought, this research articulates the movement towards a framework that fuses theoretical and experiential modes of enquiry to provide insights relevant to both interactive artists and humanities scholars. I will discuss two primary components of this framework. The first is a taxonomical model that outlines a number of characteristics of new media and interactive arts practice that engage in processes that establish a foundation for the shifts in perceptual and embodied experience that I characterize as ‘symbiogenic’. The second major component is a sketching out of the conceptual basis of the symbiogenic framework, allowing us to go deeper into examining the dynamics of what I call co-evolution by outlining four theoretical concepts that I consider to be the cornerstone of what I call symbiogenic experiences in the emergent arts: ambiguity and unknowability, boundary, distributed intentionality and collectively emergent autonomy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Castellanos","given":"Carlos"}],"citation-key":"castellanosCoevolutionNeocyberneticEmergence2016","container-title":"Technoetic Arts","DOI":"10.1386/tear.14.3.159_1","ISSN":"1477-965X, 1758-9533","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"159-168","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Co-evolution, neo-cybernetic emergence and phenomenologies of ambiguity: Towards a framework for understanding interactive arts experiences","title-short":"Co-evolution, neo-cybernetic emergence and phenomenologies of ambiguity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://intellectdiscover.com/content/journals/10.1386/tear.14.3.159_1","volume":"14"},

A combination of theater artist, scholar, researcher, play advocate, editor, and writer's friend, it is the job of a dramaturg to \"reflect light back on the elements that are already in play,\" while bringing a work of theater to life. Cattaneo traces the field from its beginnings in the eighteenth century to the present and chronicles the multitude and variety of tasks a dramaturg undertakes before, during, and after a production is brought to the stage. Using detailed stories from her work with theater artists such as Tom Stoppard, Wendy Wasserstein, Robert Wilson, Shi-Zheng Chen, and Sarah Ruhl, as well as the discovery of a 'lost' play by Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston, Cattaneo provides an invaluable manual to those studying, working in, and interested in this most fascinating profession","author":[{"family":"Cattaneo","given":"Anne"}],"call-number":"PN1661 .C38 2021","citation-key":"cattaneoArtDramaturgy2021","event-place":"New Haven ; London","ISBN":"978-0-300-23369-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","note":"OCLC: on1241245033","number-of-pages":"316","publisher":"Yale University Press","publisher-place":"New Haven ; London","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"The art of dramaturgy","type":"book"},

Sonic technologies such as audio editing platforms and music software allow students to control sound in ways that were not always possible for the average listener. While digital technologies have presented new opportunities for teaching listening in relation to composing, they also have resulted in a limited understanding of how sound works in the world at large. Ceraso offers an expansive approach to sonic pedagogy through the concept of multimodal listening--a practice that involves developing an awareness of how sound shapes and is shaped by different contexts, material objects, and bodily, multisensory experiences. Through a mix of case studies and pedagogical materials, she demonstrates how multimodal listening enables students to become more savvy consumers and producers of sound in relation to composing digital media, and in their everyday lives","author":[{"family":"Ceraso","given":"Steph"}],"citation-key":"cerasoSoundingCompositionMultimodal2018","collection-title":"Pittsburgh series in composition, literacy, and culture","event-place":"Pittsburgh, Pa","ISBN":"978-0-8229-6533-6 978-0-8229-8344-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"1","publisher":"University of Pittsburgh Press","publisher-place":"Pittsburgh, Pa","source":"K10plus ISBN","title":"Sounding composition: multimodal pedagogies for embodied listening","title-short":"Sounding composition","type":"book"},

In this multidisciplinary look at the practice of art that takes place across a distance -- geographical, temporal, or emotional -- theorists and practitioners examine the ways that art, activism, and media fundamentally reconfigured each other in experimental networked projects of the 1970s and 1980s. By providing a context for this work -- showing that it was shaped by varying mixes of social relations, cultural strategies, and political and aesthetic concerns -- At a Distance effectively refutes the widely accepted idea that networked art is technologically determined. Doing so, it provides the historical grounding needed for a more complete understanding of today's practices of Internet art and activism and suggests the possibilities inherent in networked practice. At a Distance traces the history and theory of such experimental art projects as Mail Art, sound and radio art, telematic art, assemblings, and Fluxus. Although the projects differed, a conceptual questioning of the \"art object,\" combined with a political undermining of dominant art institutional practices, animated most distance art. After a section that sets this work in historical and critical perspective, the book presents artists and others involved in this art \"re-viewing\" their work -- including experiments in \"mini-FM,\" telerobotics, networked psychoanalysis, and interactive book construction.

Así nos otorga las herramientas necesarias para entender un mundo cada vez más global e interconectado que a menudo obedece los dictados económicos. Desde el futuro del euro, la desigualdad en China o el estado de la industria americana, «Economía para el 99% de la población» es una guía concisa y amena a los fundamentos económicos que ofrece un retrato claro y completo de la economía global y de cómo influye en nuestra vida cotidiana.","author":[{"family":"Chang","given":"Ha-Joon"}],"citation-key":"changEconomiaPara992014","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",1,1]]},"language":"es","note":"Item ID: _:n8","publisher":"ePubLibre","title":"Economía para el 99% de la población","type":"book"},

Building on prior work with electromagnetic augmentation of acoustic instruments, we begin with a theory of operation model to describe the mechanical forces necessary to produce acoustic amplitude modulation synthesis. We then propose an implementation of our model as an instrumental prototype. The results illustrate that our acoustic amplitude modulation system produces controllable sideband components, and that synthesis generated from our corresponding numerical dynamic system model closely approximates the acoustic result of the physical system.","author":[{"family":"Chang","given":"Herbert H C"},{"family":"Topel","given":"Spencer"}],"citation-key":"changElectromagneticallyActuatedAcoustic2016","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Electromagnetically Actuated Acoustic Amplitude Modulation Synthesis","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"chatziioannouModellingWallVibrations2011","abstract":"The vibration of the walls of brass wind instruments has been a subject of study in the field of musical acoustics throughout the last decades. The amplitude of such vibrations, stimulated by the oscillating air pressure inside the instrument bore, is very small compared to the dimensions of the instrument. However, it has been recently shown that at the flaring regions of the bell of brass instruments the internal air pressure can excite axi-symmetric vibrations of significantly large amplitude, which can affect the sound quality. Using both two- and three-dimensional finite element modelling, this paper presents a structural analysis of brass wind instrument bells. Furthermore, a multi-physics approach using an acoustic-structure interaction model studies the effect of the wall vibrations to the acoustic response of the instrument. The obtained results are comparable to those of experimental measurements and of simplified numerical methods.","author":[{"family":"Chatziioannou","given":"Vasileios"},{"family":"Kausel","given":"Wilfried"}],"citation-key":"chatziioannouModellingWallVibrations2011","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Modelling the Wall Vibrations of Brass Wind Instruments","type":"article-journal"},

Our algorithm first precomputes a library of bistable auxetic cells to cover a range of in-plane expansion / contraction ratios, while maximizing the bistability and stiffness of the cell to ensure robust deployment. We then use metric distortion analysis of the target surface to compute the planar fabrication state as a composition of cells that best matches the desired deployment deformation. As each cell expands or contracts during deployment, metric frustration forces the surface towards its target equilibrium state.

In recent years, however, there has been an increasing amount of interest in the topic, and several publications have been devoted to acoustic guitar multiphonics. Primarily written for non-guitarist composers, these studies range from the scientific to the practical. Variously, they describe the sonic qualities of the multiphonics, discuss methods of performing them, or examine their spectral content and morphology. Until now, published research into guitar multiphonics has been limited to the acoustic guitar and has examined only its three lower strings. In this study, we analyse multiphonics on all six strings of the electric guitar and present a catalogue of harmonic aggregates on strings 3–1. We test these multiphonics on five different guitars and examine their response to three commonly used analogue effect pedals (compression, overdrive and distortion).

  {"id":"clarkExperienceMachineHow2023","abstract":"\"A grand new vision of cognitive science that explains how our minds build the world, learn from it, and sometimes deceive themselves For as long as we've studied the mind, we've believed that our senses determine what our mind perceives. But as our understanding of neuroscience and psychology has advanced in the last few decades, a new view has emerged that has proven to be both provocative and hugely powerful-that the mind is not a passive observer, but an active predictor. At the core of this research is the radical reimagination of the way our brains process sensory information. Now this new school of \"predictive processing\" is arguing that we anticipate what we will see before we process the experience. Only then does our brain compare its prediction to the sensory information. At the forefront of this research is widely acclaimed philosopher Andy Clark, who has synthesized his revolutionary work on the predictive brain to explore its fascinating mechanics and implications. The most stunning of these is the realization that experience itself, because it is guided by prior expectation, is a kind of controlled hallucination. From the most mundane experiences to the most sublime, it is the mind that shapes most of our reality. Encountering errors in prediction helps us learn and makes us confident experts, but predictive feedback loops can also lock in conditions like chronic pain, addiction, and anxiety. A landmark study of cognitive science, The Experience Machine is a grand vision that sketches the extraordinary explanatory power of the predictive brain for our lives, health, world, and society\"--","author":[{"family":"Clark","given":"Andy"}],"call-number":"BF311","citation-key":"clarkExperienceMachineHow2023","edition":"First Edition","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-1-5247-4846-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"number-of-pages":"1","publisher":"Pantheon Books","publisher-place":"New York","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"The experience machine: how our minds predict and shape reality","title-short":"The experience machine","type":"book"},

Running algorithms can be modified as they pro gress. In the context of arts computing, live coding has become an intriguing movement in the field of real-time perfor mance. It directly confronts the role of computer programmers in new media work by placing their actions, and the consequences of their actions, centrally within a work's setting. This article covers historical precedents, theoretical perspectives and recent practice. Although the contemporary exploration of live coding is associated with the rise of laptop music and visuals, there are many further links to uncover throughout rule-based art. A central issue is the role of a human being within computable structures; it is possible to find examples of live coding that do not require the use of a (digital) computer at all.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Collins","given":"Nick"}],"citation-key":"collinsLiveCodingConsequence2011","container-title":"Leonardo","container-title-short":"Leonardo","DOI":"10.1162/LEON_a_00164","ISSN":"0024-094X, 1530-9282","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",6]]},"language":"en","page":"207-211","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Live Coding of Consequence","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://direct.mit.edu/leon/article/44/3/207-211/47052","volume":"44"},

Through chapters by scholars at the forefront of research and shorter 'personal takes' from knowledgeable practitioners in the field, this Companion brings the relationship between digital technology and musical culture alive by considering both theory and practice.

The question also becomes: what are the effects of social practice art and design for the artists, institutions, and the publics they elicit in public and private spaces; that is, how can we consider such artworks differently? I argue the dilution of social practices’ potentially radical interventions into cultural processes and their absorption into larger neo liberal agendas limits how, as Jacques Rancière might argue, they can intervene in the “distribution of the sensible.” I will use a case study example from The Center for Tactical Magic, an artist group from the San Francisco Bay Area.","author":[{"family":"Coombs","given":"Gretchen"}],"citation-key":"coombsProceedingsArtAssociation2013","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Proceedings from the Art Association of Australia and New Zealand Conference, 5-8 December 2013, Melbourne, Australia.","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"crawshawElectroSomaestheticMusicSpatial2021","abstract":"This paper introduces the concept of electro-somaesthetic music (ESM) and a set of spatial approaches unique to its realization. We describe ESM as computer-generated music intended to engage the human somatosensory system as an essential artistic aim. Specifically, ESM arises from mechanical waves engaging vibration-sensitive corporeal senses by non-cochlear means. Somatic spatial perception affords vibration-based content high spatial acuity within our most proximal, intimate space: at and within the threshold of our perceived self/body from our perceived external environment. We propose that these spatial properties set ESM expressively apart from hearing-based spatial music and present a novel, nuanced territory for compositional exploration. To facilitate in spatial ESM composition and to promote compelling results therein, we advance a theoretical system of technical and aesthetic concerns, accompanied by illustrative proofs-of-concept. This paper examines three paradigms for yielding spatial content within ESM: the manipulation of physical, acoustical parameters; of virtual, computational parameters; and of non-intuitive perceptual armatures. Additionally, we examine each of these paradigms through two lenses: egocentric reference (where spatial content is limited to the body) and allocentric reference (where content is distributed within an external environment).","author":[{"family":"Crawshaw","given":"Alexis Story"}],"citation-key":"crawshawElectroSomaestheticMusicSpatial2021","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Electro-Somaesthetic Music: Spatial Approaches","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"croftCompositionNotResearch2015","abstract":"Composers in academic institutions are increasingly required to describe their activities in terms of 'research ' - formulating 'research questions', 'research narratives', 'aims' and 'outcomes'. Research plans and funding applications require one to specify the nature of the original contribution that will be made by a piece of music, even before it is composed. These requirements lead to an emphasis on collaborative work, technology and superficial novelty of format. Yet the very idea that musical composition is a form of research is a category error: music is a domain of thought whose cognitive dimension lies in embodiment, revelation or presentation, but not in investigation and description. It is argued here that the idea of composition as research is not only objectively false but inimical to genuine musical originality.","author":[{"family":"Croft","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"croftCompositionNotResearch2015","container-title":"Tempo (United Kingdom)","DOI":"10.1017/S0040298214000989","ISBN":"0040298214000","ISSN":"00402982","issue":"272","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"page":"6–11","title":"Composition is not research","type":"article-journal","volume":"69"},

He stayed there until 2:00, taking a brief break for lunch with his family, during which he often seemed to be in a trance, eating mechanically and barely speaking a word before hurrying back to his desk.

  {"id":"Czernowin2015","abstract":"While I love the voice and have used it often in my work, it has always been very difficult for me to write for it. In this essay, I try to work through some of the reasons for this difficulty. Some of the main characteristics of the voice-its fixed identity, the fact that it communicates on an instinctive level, the urgency of speech's semantic level, and the primal function of song as a collective place for the sharing of emotions-give the voice it is very special identity, importance, and urgency. We listen from inside our body. This makes the voice and instrument' that is much more powerful than any other. While it contains an endless range of expressions, the voice is so strongly contextualized that it is difficult to transform, abstract, or radically individualize. It is hard to escape the immediate signature of its unique identity. In six interventions,' I present six attempts at rethinking my automatic impulses with regard to the voice, addressing a different fixated area in each instance. The paper closes with a perspective on my work with the voice today, in which the development of earlier approaches crystallizes into a poetic proposition where the sound of the breath is an equal partner to that of the voice. This encourages the release of the nodes of our vocal fixation, and might uncover the possibility of an even stronger mutation.","author":[{"family":"Czernowin","given":"Chaya"}],"citation-key":"Czernowin2015","container-title":"Contemporary Music Review","DOI":"10.1080/07494467.2016.1150579","ISSN":"14772256","issue":"5-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"page":"449–463","title":"The primal, the abstracted and the foreign: Composing for the voice","type":"article-journal","volume":"34"},
  {"id":"dabin3DModellingPrinting2014","abstract":"This project explores the potential for 3D modelling and printing to create customised ﬂutes that can play music in a variety of microtonal scales. One of the challenges in the ﬁeld of microtonality is that conventional musical instruments are inadequate for realising the abundance of theoretical tunings that musicians wish to investigate. This paper focuses on the development of two types of ﬂutes, the recorder and transverse ﬂute, with interchangeable mouthpieces. These ﬂutes are designed to play subharmonic microtonal scales. The discussion provides an overview of the design and implementation process, including calculation methods for acoustic modelling and 3D printing technologies, as well as an evaluation of some of the diﬃculties encountered. Results from our 3D printed ﬂutes suggest that whilst further reﬁnements are necessary in our designs, 3D modelling and printing techniques oﬀer new and valuable methods for the design and production of customised musical instruments. The long term goal of this project is to create a system in which users can specify the tuning of their instrument to generate a 3D model and have it printed on demand.","author":[{"family":"Dabin","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Narushima","given":"Terumi"},{"family":"Beirne","given":"Stephen"},{"family":"Ritz","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Grady","given":"Kraig"}],"citation-key":"dabin3DModellingPrinting2014","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"3D Modelling and Printing of Microtonal Flutes","type":"article-journal"},

In Part I, a wide range of questions about the nature and definition of art are considered. Can art be defined, and if so, which definitions are the most plausible? Do we make and consume art because there are evolutionary advantages to doing so? Has art completed the mission that guided its earlier historical development, and if so, what is to become of it now? Should architecture be classified as an art form? Part II turns to the interpretation and appreciation of art. What is the target and purpose of the critic's interpretation? Is interpretation primarily directed at uncovering artists' intended meanings? Can apparently contradictory interpretations of a given piece both be true? Are interpretative evaluations entailed by descriptions of a work's aesthetic and artistic characteristics? In addition to providing answers to these and other questions in aesthetics, there is consideration of the nature and content of metaphor, and the relation between the expressive qualities of a work of art and the emotions of its creator.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Davies","given":"Stephen"}],"citation-key":"daviesPhilosophicalPerspectivesArt2007","DOI":"10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199202423.001.0001","edition":"1","ISBN":"978-0-19-920242-3 978-0-19-170854-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",7,5]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Oxford University PressOxford","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Philosophical Perspectives on Art","type":"book","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/book/8063"},

  {"id":"davisFeralCelloPhilosophically2017","abstract":"There have been many NIME papers over the years on augmented or actuated instruments [2][10][19][22]. Many of these papers have focused on the technical description of how these instruments have been produced, or as in the case of Machover’s ‘Hyperinstruments’ [19], on producing instruments over which performers have ‘absolute control’ and emphasise ‘learnability. perfectibility and repeatability’ [19]. In contrast to this approach, this paper outlines a philosophical position concerning the relationship between instruments and performers in improvisational contexts that recognises the agency of the instrument within the performance process. It builds on a post-phenomenological understanding of the human/instrument relationship in which the human and the instrument are understood as co-defining entities without fixed boundaries; an approach that actively challenges notions of instrumental mastery and ‘absolute control’. This paper then takes a practice-based approach to outline how such philosophical concerns have fed into the design of an augmented actuated cello system, The Feral Cello, that has been designed to explicitly explore these concerns through practice.","author":[{"family":"Davis","given":"Tom"}],"citation-key":"davisFeralCelloPhilosophically2017","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"The Feral Cello: A Philosophically Informed Approach to an Actuated Instrument","type":"article-journal"},

The development of this instrument is primarily a reaction to historical network performance that either attempts to present traditional acoustic practice in a distributed format or utilises the network as a conduit to shuttle acoustic and performance data amongst participant nodes. In both scenarios the network is an integral and indispensible part of the performance, however, the network is not perceived as an instrument, per se. The Loop is an attempt to create a single, distributed hybrid instrument retaining traditionally acoustic interfaces and resonant bodies that are mediated by the network.","author":[{"family":"Davis","given":"Tom"},{"family":"Geistweidt","given":"Jason E"},{"family":"Renaud","given":"Alain"},{"family":"Dixon","given":"Jason"}],"citation-key":"davisInterfacingNetworkEmbedded2011","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Interfacing the network: an embedded aproach to network instrument creation","type":"article-journal"},

De esto hace ya casi treinta años, pues el libro se publicó en 1976. Según Dawkins, los genes primigenios nos crearon a las personas y los animales, quienes somos en realidad meras «máquinas de transmisión». Como máquinas podemos funcionar mejor o peor en nuestro entorno y de este modo continuar la cadena (garantizar la supervivencia y reproducción de los genes) a lo largo del tiempo, o perecer en una selección evolutiva. En su momento fue una forma de ver las cosas al revés sobre muchas ideas tradicionales sobre la evolución centrada en los individuos o las especies (por no hablar respecto a las ideas religiosas al respecto), pero actualmente hay cierto consenso en la comunidad científica sobre que esta idea es la que probablemente más se acerca a la realidad.","author":[{"family":"Dawkins","given":"Richard"}],"citation-key":"Dawkins2008","container-title":"Salud publica de mexico","DOI":"10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61692-4.Estudios","ISBN":"84-345-8880-3","ISSN":"00363634","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"page":"353","title":"El gen egoista","type":"chapter","volume":"50"},

  {"id":"deassisExperimentalAffinitiesMusic2015","abstract":"Experimental Affinities in Music brings together diverse artistic, musicological, historical, and philosophical essays, enhancing a broad discourse on artistic experimentation, and exploring various experimental attitudes in music composed between the thirteenth and twentieth centuries. The golden thread running through the different chapters is the quest for inherently experimental musical practices, a quest pursued from interrogating, descriptive, or challenging perspectives, and always in relation to concrete music examples. Experimental is taken as an adventurous compositional, interpretive, or performative attitude that can cut across different ages and styles. Affinities suggest connectors and connections, convergences, contiguities, and adjacencies that are found in and through a diversity of approaches and topics. The texts share a common genesis: the lectures of the International Orpheus Academies for Music and Theory convened by Luk Vaes (2011) and Paulo de Assis (2012, 2013). The affinities found in this volume include essays by Lydia Goehr, Felix Diergarten, Mark Lindley, Martin Kirnbauer, Edward Wickham, Lawrence Kramer, Hermann Danuser, and Thomas Christensen, as well as interviews with pianist Leon Fleisher, with pianist-composer Frederic Rzewski, and with composer Helmut Lachenmann.

Il examine la façon dont les normes qui structurent la muséalisation et l’exposition des objets au musée dès le milieu du 19e siècle ont influencé les représentations des instruments de musique construites au siècle suivant, notamment au travers de l’élaboration d’une classification scientifique des instruments excluant toute donnée culturelle ou musicale.

It examines how this development is intertwined with the museum, looking into the ways in which the norms that structure the musealisation and the exhibition of objects in the museum have affected the representations of musical instruments, notably by influencing the elaboration of a scientific classification that leaves out the cultural and the musical aspects of the instruments.

  {"id":"delacuadraUsePhysicalmodelSynthesis2002","abstract":"As part of a collaboration project with ethnomusicologists and the Acoustique instrumentale group at IRCAM, we have studied and implement a physical model of ﬂue instrument. The model has been investigated regarding its ﬂexibility to geometry changes in the instrument, possibilities of timbre control as well as playability of the model. Two implementations have been developed: a C++ object using STK library and an external object for MAX/MSP. Implementations have been designed allowing the user to adjust many parameters in real time and evaluate the response of the model. Also a maximum-likelihood algorithm has been implemented to automatically adjust the parameters of the model to a desire timbre. Finally a real-time MIDI controller has been built to control the model. Our goal is to study the musical scales of the ﬂutes played by a tribe from North Cameroon: the Ould´em´e. Each musician normally plays two ﬂutes while and also sings a melody while inhaling. A band is usually formed by ﬁve players producing complex melodic and rhythmical textures. The ﬂutes don’t have toneholes and they are made of bamboo cane with a blowing end at one side and a close end at the other. These ﬂutes operate with a turbulent jet ﬂow. The behavior of this type of jet is less understood than the laminar one (case of recorder like instruments) and it is currently being studied in a parallel project. A one dimensional representation of the dynamics of the jet (formation, velocity ﬂuctuation, oscillations) is used as described in Verge (1995). The bore is modeled using one dimensional waveguides. Visco-thermic losses and radiation of the sound are implemented as linear ﬁlters.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Cuadra","given":"Patricio","non-dropping-particle":"de la"},{"family":"Vergez","given":"Christophe"},{"family":"Caussé","given":"René"}],"citation-key":"delacuadraUsePhysicalmodelSynthesis2002","DOI":"10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.42130","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"IRCAM","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Use of physical-model synthesis for developing experimental techniques in  ethnomusicology - The case of the Ouldémé flute","type":"book","URL":"http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/grovemusic/view/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.001.0001/omo-9781561592630-e-0000042130","volume":"1"},

En este primer tomo, El saber, se presentan las primeras 8 clases que van de octubre a diciembre de 1985. El punto de partida es que a pesar de las apariencias que lo han vinculado a la escuela de los Annales, Foucault ha insistido siempre en que no es un historiador. Así, lo que se presenta como el primer eje de la obra de Foucault, el problema y el concepto de saber, revelará todo su espesor y su riqueza. En primer lugar, la arqueología aparece no solo como método de análisis de lo visible y lo enunciable en cada formación histórica, sino también como una investigación filosófica sobre el ser del lenguaje y de la luz, opuesta al estructuralismo, a la fenomenología, y a la lingüística. En segundo lugar, como una concepción compleja y original de los vínculos entre las visibilidades y los enunciados, que se iluminará cotejándola con Kant, con Blanchot, con el cine de Syberberg, de los Straub o de Duras, y con la poesía de Raymond Roussel.

  {"id":"Deresiewicz2020","abstract":"A deeply researched warning about how the digital economy threatens artists' lives and work―the music, writing, and visual art that sustain our souls and societies―from an award-winning essayist and critic There are two stories you hear about earning a living as an artist in the digital age. One comes from Silicon Valley. There's never been a better time to be an artist, it goes. If you've got a laptop, you've got a recording studio. If you've got an iPhone, you've got a movie camera. And if production is cheap, distribution is free: it's called the Internet. Everyone's an artist; just tap your creativity and put your stuff out there. The other comes from artists themselves. Sure, it goes, you can put your stuff out there, but who's going to pay you for it? Everyone is not an artist. Making art takes years of dedication, and that requires a means of support. If things don't change, a lot of art will cease to be sustainable. So which account is true? Since people are still making a living as artists today, how are they managing to do it? William Deresiewicz, a leading critic of the arts and of contemporary culture, set out to answer those questions. Based on interviews with artists of all kinds, The Death of the Artist argues that we are in the midst of an epochal transformation. If artists were artisans in the Renaissance, bohemians in the nineteenth century, and professionals in the twentieth, a new paradigm is emerging in the digital age, one that is changing our fundamental ideas about the nature of art and the role of the artist in society.","author":[{"family":"Deresiewicz","given":"William"}],"citation-key":"Deresiewicz2020","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"title":"The death of the artist: How creators are struggling to survive in the age of billionaires and big tech","type":"document"},

  {"id":"desouzaMusicHandInstruments2017","abstract":"From prehistoric bone flutes to pipe organs to digital synthesizers, instruments have been important to musical cultures around the world. Yet, how do instruments affect musical organization? And how might they influence players' bodies and minds? Music at Hand explores these questions with a distinctive blend of music theory, psychology, and philosophy. Practicing an instrument, of course, builds bodily habits and skills. But it also develops connections between auditory and motor regions in a player's brain. These multi-sensory links are grounded in particular instrumental interfaces. They reflect the ways that an instrument converts action into sound, and the ways that it coordinates physical and tonal space. Ultimately, these connections can shape listening, improvisation, or composition. This means that pianos, guitars, horns, and bells are not simply tools for making notes. Such technologies, as creative prostheses, also open up possibilities for musical action, perception, and cognition. Throughout the book, author Jonathan De Souza examines diverse musical case studies-from Beethoven to blues harmonica, from Bach to electronic music-introducing novel methods for the analysis of body-instrument interaction. A companion website supports these analytical discussions with audiovisual examples, including motion-capture videos and performances by the author. Written in lucid prose, Music at Hand offers substantive insights for music scholars, while remaining accessible to non-specialist readers. This wide-ranging book will engage music theorists and historians, ethnomusicologists, organologists, composers, and performers-but also psychologists, philosophers, media theorists, and anyone who is curious about how musical experience is embodied and conditioned by technology [Publisher description]","author":[{"family":"De Souza","given":"Jonathan"}],"citation-key":"desouzaMusicHandInstruments2017","collection-title":"Oxford studies in music theory","event-place":"New York, NY","ISBN":"978-0-19-027111-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher-place":"New York, NY","source":"BnF ISBN","title":"Music at hand: instruments, bodies, and cognition","title-short":"Music at hand","type":"book"},

  {"id":"devenishContemporaryMusicalVirtuosities2023","abstract":"This chapter presents an overview of some of the diverse notions of virtuosity present in contemporary western art music practices, that redevelop historic concepts and acknowledge the diversity of contributions to western art music. Here, we bring together current terms that aim to account for and embrace the evolving practices, practitioners, and presentation models within twenty-first century music making contexts, which have laid a foundation for the explorations of virtuosity offered by musicians and scholars in this volume. This includes examples such as ‘interdisciplinary virtuosity’, ‘non-sonic virtuosity’, ‘social virtuosity’, and ‘everyday virtuosity’. These, and other notions articulated across Eurological concert music, experimental music, performance art, sound art, and digital sonic practices demonstrate how broadly virtuosity can be engaged. The chapter commences with a summary of existing literature, followed by an introduction to the exciting ideas and diverse perspectives presented in this edited collection of academic essays, artist reflections, interviews, letters, and one manifesto.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Devenish","given":"Louise"},{"family":"Hope","given":"Cat"},{"family":"McAuliffe","given":"Sam"}],"citation-key":"devenishContemporaryMusicalVirtuosities2023","container-author":[{"family":"Devenish","given":"Louise"},{"family":"Hope","given":"Cat"}],"container-title":"Contemporary Musical Virtuosities","DOI":"10.4324/9781003307969-1","edition":"1","event-place":"London","ISBN":"978-1-003-30796-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,12]]},"language":"en","page":"1-13","publisher":"Routledge","publisher-place":"London","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Contemporary musical virtuosities","type":"chapter","URL":"https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781003307969/chapters/10.4324/9781003307969-1"},

  {"id":"diamondArmasGermenesAcero2019","abstract":"La narración comienza hace 13 000 años, cuando los cazadores recolectores de la Edad de Piedra constituían la totalidad de la población humana. En aquella época comenzaron a tomar rumbos diferentes en los distintos continentes las sendas de la evolución de las sociedades humanas. La pronta domesticación de animales y el cultivo de plantas silvestres en el Creciente Fértil, China, Mesoamérica, el sureste de los actuales Estados Unidos y otras zonas otorgó una ventaja inicial a los habitantes de estas regiones. Hasta ahora apenas se sabía por qué el trigo y el maíz, la vaca y el cerdo, tan consumidos en el mundo moderno, aparecieron como especies domésticas en esas regiones en particular y no en otras. Los orígenes localizados de la agricultura y la ganadería sólo son una parte de la explicación de los diferentes destinos de los distintos pueblos. La gran desigualdad en el ritmo de difusión de la producción de alimentos desde esos centros iniciales tuvo mucho que ver con otras características climáticas y geográficas. Las sociedades que fueron más allá de la fase de cazadores-recolectores tenían más probabilidades de desarrollar la escritura, la tecnología, las estructuras políticas, las religiones organizadas, además de gérmenes nocivos y poderosas armas de guerra. Armas, gérmenes y acero supone un avance fundamental en nuestra comprensión de las sociedades humanas. Expone cómo el mundo moderno y sus desigualdades han llegado a ser como son. «Ningún científico aporta más experiencia de laboratorio y de campo, ninguno reflexiona con más profundidad sobre cuestiones sociales, ni las trata con más claridad, que Jared Diamond, como pone de manifiesto Armas, gérmenes y acero.

Central to the paper is an understanding of ‘interaction’ as a network of interdependencies among system components, and as a means for dynamical behaviour to emerge upon the contact of an autonomous system (e.g. a DSP unit) with the external environment (room or else hosting the performance).

In this paper, we have analyzed the acoustic properties of the Helmholtz resonators-based metamaterial plate experimentally as well as numerically. The experimental results are in good agreement with the numerical results. These types of 3D-printed metamaterial plates can find their application where high sound transmission loss is required to create a quieter ambience. There is an additional advantage of being lightweight because of the Helmholtz resonator-shaped cavities built inside the plate.

How can we manage those? What is actually their meaning? What is the relationship that links that meaning with the social? The answers will come along from the material culture proposals. But the elaboration of this one demands the revision of the G.H.Mead’s proposals. Four topics from George Herbert Mead’s broad and varied treatment of the physical object have been selected for examination: the function of objects in the definition of the bodily self and its environment; the phenomena of resistance and interiorization in the self ’s contact with physical objects; the self ’s identification with the world of physical object and the perceptual and manipulatory phases of the act. This paper reviews all these questions. And we will conclude that they constitute the first steps to outline a Social Psychology of the objects.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Doménech","given":"Miquel"},{"family":"Iñiguez-Rueda","given":"Lupicinio"}],"citation-key":"domenechNOTITLEAVAILABLE2003","container-title":"Psicologia & Sociedade","container-title-short":"Psicol.

  {"id":"dovydaitisCelebrationHyperrealNostalgia2021","abstract":"Vaporwave grabs the attention of internet voyager with harsh collages glued together in a technically primitive manner. It’s a cultural phenomenon which both originated and is active solely on the internet. In the context of general internet culture Vaporwave is exclusive in its aesthetics due to the domination of violet and pink colors, technically primitive quality of texts, fetishization of 8th and 9th decade mainstream commodities and acute nostalgic undertones. Vaporwave has been mostly explored as a music genre or sociological phenomenon, while its visual aspect has mostly remained unattended. This article seeks to analyze the conceptual aspects embodied within Vaporwave visuals, to briefly compare them with music, and to unpack the mechanism of nostalgia as an affective entry point to the movement. The interpretation is mainly lead by Jean Baudrillard’s theory of hyperreality, and interpretational principles of hermeneutics. Five Tumblr blogs were analyzed. Hermeneutic inquiry into the texts yielded seven distinct symbol categories differentiated by the affect they generate: nostalgic commodities, idyllic classics, melancholic landscapes, harsh distortions, gentle geometry, depressive texts, and ecstatic brands. Each of these categories here are elaborated in detail finally summarizing the multilayered symbolism of the movement. It can be described as nostalgically challenging visual conventions through harsh technical quality and opposing codes of behavior through open expressions of depression and melancholy, thus exposing the doubts of individual imprisoned in postmodern society. ’80s and ’90s here become hyperreal fantasy lands of the past where a nostalgic individual can find refuge. In comparison to music, the visual aspect of Vaporwave highlights the technology as central artefacts of nostalgia, introduces new ways to analyze late capitalist consumer culture, and brings an intimate dialogue with hyperreality to the front. The article suggests that Vaporwave is a post-ironic art movement which both celebrates and criticizes capitalism, finally remaining vague whether there are ways to escape the system, and whether these ways should even be looked for.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Dovydaitis","given":"Gytis"}],"citation-key":"dovydaitisCelebrationHyperrealNostalgia2021","container-title":"Art History & Criticism","DOI":"10.2478/mik-2021-0010","ISSN":"1822-4547","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"113-134","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Celebration of the Hyperreal Nostalgia: Categorization and Analysis of Visual Vaporwave Artefacts","title-short":"Celebration of the Hyperreal Nostalgia","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciendo.com/article/10.2478/mik-2021-0010","volume":"17"},

  {"id":"dukeThinkingBetsMaking2019","abstract":"\"Poker champion turned business consultant Annie Duke teaches you how to get comfortable with uncertainty and make better decisions as a result. In Super Bowl XLIX, Seahawks coach Pete Carroll made one of the most controversial calls in football history: With 26 seconds remaining, and trailing by four at the Patriots' one-yard line, he called for a pass instead of a hand off to his star running back. The pass was intercepted and the Seahawks lost. Critics called it the dumbest play in history. But was the call really that bad? Or did Carroll actually make a great move that was ruined by bad luck? Even the best decision doesn't yield the best outcome every time. There's always an element of luck that you can't control, and there is always information that is hidden from view. So the key to long-term success (and avoiding worrying yourself to death) is to think in bets: How sure am I? What are the possible ways things could turn out? What decision has the highest odds of success? Did I land in the unlucky 10% on the strategy that works 90% of the time? Or is my success attributable to dumb luck rather than great decision making? Annie Duke, a former World Series of Poker champion turned business consultant, draws on examples from business, sports, politics, and (of course) poker to share tools anyone can use to embrace uncertainty and make better decisions. For most people, it's difficult to say \"I'm not sure\" in a world that values and, even, rewards the appearance of certainty. But professional poker players are comfortable with the fact that great decisions don't always lead to great outcomes and bad decisions don't always lead to bad outcomes. By shifting your thinking from a need for certainty to a goal of accurately assessing what you know and what you don't, you'll be less vulnerable to reactive emotions, knee-jerk biases, and destructive habits in your decision making. You'll become more confident, calm, compassionate and successful in the long run\"-- Provided by publisher","author":[{"family":"Duke","given":"Annie"}],"citation-key":"dukeThinkingBetsMaking2019","event-place":"New York, New York","ISBN":"978-0-7352-1637-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"eng","note":"OCLC: 1048947227","publisher":"Portfolio/Penguin","publisher-place":"New York, New York","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Thinking in bets: making smarter decisions when you don't have all the facts","title-short":"Thinking in bets","type":"book"},

In this study, four elements were chosen from the multidimensional network involved in playing a normal tone, and then each was intentionally decoupled from ordinario. These elements (bow speed, bow placement, bow angle, and bow portion) were scaled between minimal and maximal values for any single parameter. Then, between minimal and maximal values, a series of scalar degrees were chosen to more or less uniformly link these extremes. This article will present acoustical attributes of these methods and discuss implications for musical usage.

Built from retro-ﬁtted acoustic cellos, the signals from electromagnetic pickups sitting under each string are passed to a speaker built into the back of the instrument and to transducers clamped in varying places across the instrument body. Placement of acoustic and mechanical actuators on the resonant body of the cello mean that this simple analogue feedback system is capable of a wide range of complex self-resonating behaviours. This paper describes the motivations for building these instruments as both a physical extension to live coding practice and an electroacoustic augmentation of cello. The design and physical construction is outlined, and modes of performance described with reference to the ﬁrst six months of performances and installations. Future developments and planned investigations are outlined.","author":[{"family":"Eldridge","given":"Alice"},{"family":"Kiefer","given":"Chris"}],"citation-key":"eldridgeSelfresonatingFeedbackCello2012","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"The Self-resonating Feedback Cello: Interfacing gestural and generative processes in improvised performance","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"elliottAcousticStructureFive2013","abstract":"Attempts to relate the perceptual dimensions of timbre to quantitative acoustical dimensions have been tenuous, leading to claims that timbre is an emergent property, if measurable at all. Here, a three-pronged analysis shows that the timbre space of sustained instrument tones occupies 5 dimensions and that a specific combination of acoustic properties uniquely determines gestalt perception of timbre. Firstly, multidimensional scaling (MDS) of dissimilarity judgments generated a perceptual timbre space in which 5 dimensions were cross-validated and selected by traditional model comparisons. Secondly, subjects rated tones on semantic scales. A discriminant function analysis (DFA) accounting for variance of these semantic ratings across instruments and between subjects also yielded 5 significant dimensions with similar stimulus ordination. The dimensions of timbre space were then interpreted semantically by rotational and reflectional projection of the MDS solution into two DFA dimensions. Thirdly, to relate this final space to acoustical structure, the perceptual MDS coordinates of each sound were regressed with its joint spectrotemporal modulation power spectrum. Sound structures correlated significantly with distances in perceptual timbre space. Contrary to previous studies, most perceptual timbre dimensions are not the result of purely temporal or spectral features but instead depend on signature spectrotemporal patterns.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Elliott","given":"Taffeta M."},{"family":"Hamilton","given":"Liberty S."},{"family":"Theunissen","given":"Frédéric E."}],"citation-key":"elliottAcousticStructureFive2013","container-title":"The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America","DOI":"10.1121/1.4770244","ISSN":"0001-4966, 1520-8524","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"389-404","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Acoustic structure of the five perceptual dimensions of timbre in orchestral instrument tones","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubs.aip.org/jasa/article/133/1/389/929560/Acoustic-structure-of-the-five-perceptual","volume":"133"},

Writing amidst the rise of books in the 1970s on pollution, over-population, and environmental degradation, Ellul found it necessary, once again, to write about the global presence of technology and its far-reaching effects. The Technological System represents a new stage in Ellul's research. Previously he studied technological society as such; in this book he approaches the topic from a systems perspective wherein he identifies the characteristics of technological phenomena and technological progress in light of system theory. This leads to an entirely new approach to what constitutes the most important event of our society which has decisive bearing on the future of our world. Ellul's analysis touches on all aspects of modern life, not just those of a scientific or technological order.

  {"id":"erikssonConsciousBrain2007","abstract":"Although consciousness has been studied since ancient time, how the brain implements consciousness is still considered a great mystery by most. This thesis investigates the neural correlates of consciousness by measuring brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while specific contents of consciousness are defined and maintained in various experimental settings. Study 1 showed that the brain works differently when creating a new conscious percept compared to when maintaining the same percept over time. Specifically, sensory and fronto-parietal regions were activated for both conditions but with different activation patterns within these regions. This distinction between creating and maintaining a conscious percept was further supported by Study 2, which in addition showed that there are both differences and similarities in how the brain works when defining a visual compared to an auditory percept. In particular, frontal cortex was commonly activated while posterior cortical activity was modality specific. Study 3 showed that task difficulty influenced the degree of frontal and parietal cortex involvement, such that fronto-parietal activity decreased as a function of ease of identification. This is interpreted as evidence of the non-necessity of these regions for conscious perception in situations where the stimuli are distinct and apparent. Based on these results a model is proposed where sensory regions interact with controlling regions to enable conscious perception. The amount and type of required interaction depend on stimuli and task characteristics, to the extent that higher-order cortical involvement may not be required at all for easily recognizable stimuli.","author":[{"family":"Eriksson","given":"Johan"}],"citation-key":"erikssonConsciousBrain2007","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"The Conscious Brain","type":"article-journal"},

In Hooked, Nir Eyal reveals how successful companies create products people can't put down - and how you can too'. A must-read for everyone who cares about driving customer engagement' Eric Ries, author of The Lean Startup. 'The most high bandwidth, high octane, and valuable presentation I have ever seen on this subject' Rory Sutherland, vice chairman, Ogilvy & Mather. Winner of best Marketing book in 800-CEO-READ Business Book Awards 2014'The book everyone in Silicon Valley is talking about' Boris Veldhuijzen van Zanten, founder of The Next Web. Why do some products capture our attention while others flop? What makes us engage with certain things out of sheer habit? Is there an underlying pattern to how technologies hook us? Nir Eyal answers these questions (and many more) with the Hook Model - a four-step process that, when embedded into products, subtly encourages customer behaviour. Through consecutive \"hook cycles,\" these products bring people back again and again without depending on costly advertising or aggressive messaging. Hooked is based on Eyal's years of research, consulting, and practical experience. He wrote the book he wished had been available to him as a start-up founder - not abstract theory, but a how-to guide for building better products. Hooked is written for product managers, designers, marketers, start-up founders, and anyone who seeks to understand how products influence our behaviour. Eyal provides readers with practical insights to create user habits that stick; actionable steps for building products people love; and riveting examples from the iPhone to Twitter, Pinterest and the Bible App. Nir Eyal spent years in the video gaming and advertising industries where he learned, applied, and at times rejected, techniques described in Hooked to motivate and influence users. He has taught courses on applied consumer psychology at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design and is a frequent speaker at industry conferences and at Fortune 500 companies. His writing on technology, psychology, and business appears in the Harvard Business Review, The Atlantic, TechCrunch, and Psychology Today. Ryan Hoover's writing has appeared in Tech- Crunch, The Next Web, Forbes, and Fast Company.

  {"id":"fascianiVoiceControlledInterfaceDigital2014","abstract":"In recent decades, the sonic capabilities of digital musical instruments have significantly increased and today musicians confront a very high dimensional control space for interacting with these complex devices. The exploitation of the musical potential represents a significant challenge, as can be appreciated by surveying the proliferation of novel interfaces and techniques to map the performer gesture to instrument controls. Body gesture and in particular hand interaction have intrinsic limits on the number of instrument parameters that can be controlled simultaneously. This thesis proposes an approach in which gestures derived from the vocal timbre are used to extend common musical interfaces, providing an additional control layer for any sound synthesis or processing device.","author":[{"family":"Fasciani","given":"Stefano"}],"citation-key":"fascianiVoiceControlledInterfaceDigital2014","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Voice-Controlled Interface for Digital Musical Instruments","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"fayeBaradBohrQuantum2021","abstract":"The last decade has seen an increasing number of references to quantum mechanics in the humanities and social sciences. This development has in particular been driven by Karen Barad’s agential realism: a theoretical framework that, based on Niels Bohr’s interpretation of quantum mechanics, aims to inform social theorizing. In dealing with notions such as agency, power, and embodiment as well as the relation between the material and the discursive level, the influence of agential realism in fields such as feminist science studies and posthumanism has been profound. However, no one has hitherto paused to assess agential realism’s proclaimed quantum mechanical origin including its relation to the writings of Niels Bohr. This is the task taken up here. We find that many of the implications that agential realism allegedly derives from a Bohrian interpretation of quantum mechanics dissent from Bohr’s own views and are in conflict with those of other interpretations of quantum mechanics. Agential realism is at best consistent with quantum mechanics and consequently, it does not capture what quantum mechanics in any strict sense implies for social science or any other domain of inquiry. Agential realism may be interesting and thought provoking from the perspective of social theorizing, but it is neither sanctioned by quantum mechanics nor by Bohr’s authority. This conclusion not only holds for agential realism in particular, it also serves as a general warning against the other attempts to use quantum mechanics in social theorizing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Faye","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Jaksland","given":"Rasmus"}],"citation-key":"fayeBaradBohrQuantum2021","container-title":"Synthese","container-title-short":"Synthese","DOI":"10.1007/s11229-021-03160-1","ISSN":"0039-7857, 1573-0964","issue":"3-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12]]},"language":"en","page":"8231-8255","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Barad, Bohr, and quantum mechanics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11229-021-03160-1","volume":"199"},

  {"id":"Feenberg2010","abstract":"The technologies, markets, and administrations of today's knowledge society are in crisis. We face recurring disasters in every domain: climate change, energy shortages, economic meltdown. The system is broken, despite everything the technocrats claim to know about science, technology, and economics. These problems are exacerbated by the fact that today powerful technologies have unforeseen effects that disrupt everyday life; the new masters of technology are not restrained by the lessons of experience, and accelerate change to the point where society is in constant turmoil. In Between Reason and Experience, leading philosopher of technology Andrew Feenberg makes a case for the interdependence of reason–scientific knowledge, technical rationality–and experience. Feenberg examines different aspects of the tangled relationship between technology and society from the perspective of critical theory of technology, an approach he has pioneered over the past twenty years. Feenberg points to two examples of democratic interventions into technology: the Internet and the environmental movement. He examines methodological applications of critical theory of technology to the case of the French Minitel computing network and to the relationship between national culture and technology in Japan. Finally, Feenberg considers the philosophies of technology of Heidegger, Habermas, Latour, and Marcuse. The gradual extension of democracy into the technical sphere, Feenberg argues, is one of the great political transformations of our time","author":[{"family":"Feenberg","given":"Andrew"}],"citation-key":"Feenberg2010","container-title":"Nachdenken über technik","DOI":"10.5771/9783845269238-422-1","event-place":"London","ISBN":"978-0-262-51425-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"page":"422–427","publisher":"The MIT Press","publisher-place":"London","title":"Between reason and experience: Essays in technology and modernity","type":"chapter"},

  {"id":"felixEffectBendingPortions2008","abstract":"The need to keep long wind musical instruments compact imposes the bending of portions of the air column. Although manufacturers and players mention its effects as being significant, the curvature is generally not included in physical models and only a few studies, in only simplified cases, attempted to evaluate its influence. The aim of our study is to quantify the influence of the curvature by modelling the wave propagation in an air column with a multimodal formalism. In a duct with a circular cross-section and a finite curvature, two infinite sets of coupled first-order differential equations are constructed for the components of the pressure and axial velocity, projected on the local transverse modes. From these an impedance matrix is defined, which can be easily calculated, particularly when considering a duct with a piecewise constant curvature. Influence of the curvature on the input impedance, effective length, or playing frequencies is then quantified, displaying notably a dependence to frequency such that, compared to an equivalent straight tube, the shift in resonance frequencies in a tube with bent sections is not always positive, as generally stated. Results are independently corroborated by numerical - finite differences - computations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Félix","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Nederveen","given":"Cornelis J."},{"family":"Dalmont","given":"Jean-Pierre"},{"family":"Gilbert","given":"Joël"}],"citation-key":"felixEffectBendingPortions2008","container-title":"The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America","DOI":"10.1121/1.2934264","ISSN":"0001-4966, 1520-8524","issue":"5_Supplement","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"3447-3447","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Effect of bending portions of the air column on the acoustical properties of a wind instrument","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubs.aip.org/jasa/article/123/5_Supplement/3447/625638/Effect-of-bending-portions-of-the-air-column-on","volume":"123"},

One axis is the player's transparency scale, while the other is the audience's transparency scale. Through consideration of both traditional instrumentation and new technology-driven interfaces, we explore the role that metaphor plays in developing expressive devices. Metaphor depends on a literature, which forms the basis for making transparent device mappings. We examine four examples of systems that use metaphor: Iamascope, Sound Sculpting, MetaMuse, and Glove-TalkII; and discuss implications on transparency and expressivity.

  {"id":"fengCreatingImmersiveVirtualReality2024","abstract":"The last decade has witnessed rapid development of immersive virtual reality (IVR) and its application in various contexts. However, its application in supporting real-time virtual collaboration has been quite rare due to technical barriers and the lack of validated design principles. To address this research gap, this study designed and developed an IVR space to enable multi-user synchronous co-located collaboration. An evaluation study (N = 95) was conducted to explore its useful design considerations and the influencing factors for collaboration experience. The IVR space was enabled by the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)-based inside-out tracking technique and was informed by four essential design considerations for promoting effective collaboration in IVR, namely, the role script, learning task, collaboration mechanism, and communication design. The study results revealed that students in general were satisfied with their collaboration experience in IVR, with social presence and collaboration competency as significant predictors of collective efficacy and social experience. Based on both quantitative and qualitative results, this study proposes four validated principles for designing effective IVR spaces to support synchronous co-located collaboration.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Feng","given":"Qinna"},{"family":"Luo","given":"Heng"},{"family":"Li","given":"Zijian"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Jiarong"},{"family":"Li","given":"Gege"},{"family":"Yi","given":"Yan"}],"citation-key":"fengCreatingImmersiveVirtualReality2024","DOI":"10.20944/preprints202402.0441.v1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,7]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","publisher":"Computer Science and Mathematics","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Creating an Immersive Virtual-Reality Space for Multiuser Synchronous Co-Located Collaboration: Design Considerations and Influencing Factors","title-short":"Creating an Immersive Virtual-Reality Space for Multiuser Synchronous Co-Located Collaboration","type":"article","URL":"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202402.0441/v1"},

However, access to treatment is limited by the need for trained music therapists and the difficulty of quantitatively measuring efficacy in treatment. We present a survey of digital music systems that utilize biosensing for the purpose of reducing stress and anxiety with therapeutic use of music. The survey analyzes biosensing instruments for brain activity, cardiovascular, electrodermal, and respiratory measurements for efficacy in reduction in stress and anxiety. The survey also emphasizes digital music systems where biosensing is utilized to adapt music playback to the subject, forming a biofeedback loop. We also discuss how these digital music systems can use biofeedback coupled with machine learning to provide improved efficacy. Lastly, we posit that such digital music systems can be realized using consumer-grade biosensing wearables coupled with smartphones. Such systems can provide benefit to music therapists as well as to anyone wanting to treat stress from daily living.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Ferguson","given":"Arron"},{"family":"Castellanos","given":"Carlos"},{"family":"Pasquier","given":"Philippe"}],"citation-key":"fergusonDigitalMusicInterventions2023","container-title":"Frontiers in Computer Science","container-title-short":"Front.

  {"id":"fernandezBornOppenheimerApproximation2019","abstract":"The Born-Oppenheimer approximation is almost invariably the mandatory starting point for the quantum-mechanical treatment of molecular systems. It consists on the separation of the electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom which is possible because of the enormous diﬀerence between the masses of these two kinds of particles. As a result one is left with two equations that should be solved successively. The ﬁrst one is an eigenvalue equation for the electrons with the nuclei clamped at selected locations in space (nuclear conﬁguration). After solving it for a suﬃciently large number of conﬁgurations then one solves the second equation for the motion of the nuclei on a potential-energy surface. The eigenvalues of the second equation are approximations to the allowed energies of the molecule. In the case of the ground state, the Born-Oppenheimer energy is an upper bound to the actual allowed energy of the molecule.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Fernández","given":"Francisco M"}],"citation-key":"fernandezBornOppenheimerApproximation2019","DOI":"10.13140/RG.2.2.21650.91840","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Unpublished","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"The Born-Oppenheimer approximation","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://rgdoi.net/10.13140/RG.2.2.21650.91840"},

  {"id":"fiebrinkMachineLearningAlgorithm2016","abstract":"Machine learning is the capacity of a computational system to learn structures from datasets in order to make predictions on newly seen data. Such an approach offers a significant advantage in music scenarios in which musicians can teach the system to learn an idiosyncratic style, or can break the rules to explore the system's capacity in unexpected ways. In this chapter we draw on music, machine learning, and human-computer interaction to elucidate an understanding of machine learning algorithms as creative tools for music and the sonic arts. We motivate a new understanding of learning algorithms as human-computer interfaces. We show that, like other interfaces, learning algorithms can be characterised by the ways their affordances intersect with goals of human users. We also argue that the nature of interaction between users and algorithms impacts the usability and usefulness of those algorithms in profound ways. This human-centred view of machine learning motivates our concluding discussion of what it means to employ machine learning as a creative tool.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Fiebrink","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"Caramiaux","given":"Baptiste"}],"citation-key":"fiebrinkMachineLearningAlgorithm2016","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.1611.00379","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"es","number":"arXiv:1611.00379","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"The Machine Learning Algorithm as Creative Musical Tool[esp]","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00379"},

It begins by arguing that it is important to teach machine learning to creative practitioners and to conduct research about this teaching, drawing on related work in creative machine learning, creative computing education, and machine learning education. It then draws on research about design processes in engineering and creative practice to motivate a set of learning objectives for students who wish to design new creative artifacts with machine learning. The article then draws on education research and knowledge of creative computing practices to propose a set of teaching strategies that can be used to support creative computing students in achieving these objectives. Explanations of these strategies are accompanied by concrete descriptions of how they have been employed to develop new lectures and activities, and to design new experiential learning and scaffolding technologies, for teaching some of the first courses in the world focused on teaching machine learning to creative practitioners. The article subsequently draws on data collected from these courses—an online course as well as undergraduate and masters-level courses taught at a university—to begin to understand how this curriculum supported student learning, to understand learners’ challenges and mistakes, and to inform future teaching and research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Fiebrink","given":"Rebecca"}],"citation-key":"fiebrinkMachineLearningEducation2019","container-title":"ACM Transactions on Computing Education","container-title-short":"ACM Trans.

  {"id":"Fisher2009","abstract":"Como dijera alguna vez Fredric Jameson, hoy parece “más fácil imaginar el fin del mundo que el fin del capitalismo”. Después de la caída del muro de Berlín, el capitalismo logró erigirse como el único sistema político-económico viable; una situación que la crisis bancaria de 2008, lejos de poner fin, agravó. Este libro analiza los principales rasgos y mecanismos de este realismo capitalista, como el marco ideológico en el cual vivimos. Utilizando ejemplos de la política, el cine, la música y la literatura, Mark Fisher demuestra de qué manera el realismo capitalista permea todas las áreas de la experiencia contemporánea, cubriendo el horizonte de lo pensable y obturando la capacidad de imaginar un nuevo escenario cultural y sociopolítico. El famoso eslogan de Margaret Thatcher, según el cual “no hay alternativa”, situó al liberalismo económico y con ello al libre comercio y la desregulación del mercado como el mejor y único modo para organizar las sociedades modernas. Realismo capitalista indaga en los numerosos efectos nocivos que esta “ontología de los negocios” tiene para la vida pública, dejando al desnudo que el capitalismo es todo menos un orden natural inevitable y eficiente. La precarización del trabajo, la intensificación de la cultura del consumo, la expansión de la burocracia y de los mecanismos de control social, la gerencialización de la política, la mercantilización de la educación y el aumento de padecimientos mentales como el estrés, la depresión y los desórdenes de atención se muestran bajo esta perspectiva ya no como “errores honestos” de un sistema que tiende al bien común, sino como dispositivos orientados a bloquear toda capacidad colectiva de transformación. Ante este escenario, el único antídoto posible esbozado por Fisher en los dos textos que componen el Apéndice y que se agregan especialmente para esta edición, pasa por la revitalización de una esfera pública que asuma las raíces sociales de nuestra infelicidad.","author":[{"family":"Fisher","given":"Mark"}],"citation-key":"Fisher2009","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"publisher":"ePubLibre","title":"Realismo capitalista. ¿No hay alternativa?","type":"chapter"},

  {"id":"fletcherAcousticSystemsBiology1993","abstract":"This book is a practical guide for researchers and advanced graduate students in biology and biophysics who need a quantitative understanding of acoustical systems such as hearing, sound production, and vibration detection in animals at the physiological level. It begins with an introduction to physical acoustics, covering the fundamental concepts and showing how they can be applied quantitatively to understand auditory and sound-producing systems in animals. Only after the relatively simple mechanical part of the system is explained does the author focus his attention on the underlying physiological processes. The book is written on three levels. For those wanting a brief survey of the field, each chapter begins with a nonmathematical synopsis which summarizes the content and refers to the figures, all of which are designed to be understood apart from the main text. At the next level, the reader can follow the main text, but need not give close attention to anything but the general concepts and techniques involved. At the third level, the reader should follow the mathematical arguments in detail and attempt the discussion of questions at the end of each chapter. The author has provided detailed solutions which serve to expand the discussions of particular cases.","author":[{"family":"Fletcher","given":"Neville H."},{"family":"Fahey","given":"Paul"}],"citation-key":"fletcherAcousticSystemsBiology1993","DOI":"10.1063/1.2808977","ISBN":"0-19-506940-4","ISSN":"0031-9228","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["1993"]]},"title":"Acoustic systems in biology","type":"book","volume":"46"},

Aunque estuve semanas corrigiéndolo, dudo que la última versión haya perfeccionado en algo lo que había ido desgranándose aquella madrugada de calor. El relato venía sobrecargado de propósitos teóricos y abunda en guiños, anagramas, provocaciones al Estado policial de la época e insidias a escritores de moda. Como suele ocurrir, todo eso pasó inadvertido a los lectores y al jurado que le concedió el primer premio en el certamen más concurrido de 1980. Paradojalmente, los auspiciantes del concurso —una fábrica de gaseosas— quisieron publicar este relato bajo el lema «Cómo crean en libertad los jóvenes argentinos». Yo era argentino, pero ya no era joven y por entonces la noción de libertad me resultaba tan hueca y banal como ahora. Creo que el relato es elocuente al respecto. Por efecto de éste y otros textos contemporáneos más, yo, un hombre grande, comprometido en una carrera empresaria, terminé creyendo que era un escritor y que debía escribir y cambiar de oficio. Visto desde la perspectiva de la especie, puedo atribuir a Muchacha punk el origen de una trama de malentendidos y desgracias a la que la presente publicación viene a agregar un nudo. R.

El rigor, la originalidad, la inspiración de Michel Foucault ofrecen una mirada radicalmente nueva sobre el pasado de la cultura Occidental y una concepción más lúcida de su confuso presente. La descripción y el análisis del saber —y aquí Foucault examinó en detalle la evolución de la economía, la biología y la lingüística, terminando por dar cuenta del psicoanálisis y de la etnología— es la tarea que se impuso en este libro. ¿Es del hombre de quien hay que hablar? ¿Es el objeto (y el sujeto) único del saber racional? Esto es lo que Foucault, finalmente, pone en duda. Su analítica de la finitud muestra a la vez por qué la noción del hombre desempeña un papel tan eminente y usurpa, irrisoriamente, ese mismo papel.","author":[{"family":"Foucault","given":"Michel"}],"citation-key":"foucaultPalabrasCosas1966","issued":{"date-parts":[["1966"]]},"language":"es","note":"Item ID: _:n1","publisher":"ePubLibre","title":"Las palabras y las cosas","type":"book"},

  {"id":"frauenbergerEntanglementHCINext2020","abstract":"This article argues that our intimate entanglement with digital technologies is challenging the foundations of current HCI research and practice. Our relationships to virtual realities, artificial intelligence, neuro-implants or pervasive, cyberphysical systems generate ontological uncertainties, epistemological diffusion and ethical conundrums that require us to consider evolving the current research paradigm. I look to post-humanism and relational ontologies to sketch what I call Entanglement HCI in response. I review selected theories—Actor-Network Theory, Post-Phenomenology, Object-Oriented Ontology, Agential Realism—and their existing influences on HCI literature. Against this background, I develop Entanglement HCI from the following four perspectives: (a) the performative relationship between humans and technology; (b) the re-framing of knowledge generation processes around phenomena; (c) the tracing of accountabilities, responsibilities and ethical encounters; and (d) the practices of design and mattering that move beyond user-centred design.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Frauenberger","given":"Christopher"}],"citation-key":"frauenbergerEntanglementHCINext2020","container-title":"ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction","container-title-short":"ACM Trans.

  {"id":"frolova-wakerRimskyKorsakovHisWorld2018","abstract":"Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.","author":[{"family":"Frolova-Waker","given":"Marina"}],"citation-key":"frolova-wakerRimskyKorsakovHisWorld2018","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"publisher":"Princeton University Press","title":"Rimsky-Korsakov and his world","type":"book"},

  {"id":"gabrielliNetworkedMusicPerformance2016","abstract":"Networked music performances have been considered since a few decades in contemporary music composition. More recently, the enabling technologies for NMP have been also considered as a way to deliver classes to facilitate rehearsal or conduct proper music improvisation. Unfortunately after a few years of experiments through the Internet the interest has shifted toward the use of NMP for composition only and advancement in avant-garde music practice. NMP is also a means of reﬂection for the artists and the composer over new media technologies. For these reasons planning a NMP requires an interdisciplinary approach, evaluating both aesthetic and technical issues. In this book, intended for the technical reader, only the latter shall be addressed. However, to ease the exchange and expedite collaboration between technologists and artists an introduction on historical and current practices in NMP is provided.

  {"id":"galanterWhatGenerativeArt","abstract":"In this paper an attempt is made to offer a definition of generative art that is inclusive and provides fertile ground for both technical and art theoretical development. First the use of systems is identified as a key element in generative art. Various ideas from complexity theory are then introduced. It is noted that systems exist on a continuum from the highly ordered to the highly disordered. Citing examples from information theory and complexity science, it is noted that highly ordered and highly disordered systems are typically viewed as simple, and complex systems exhibit both order and disorder. This leads to the adoption of effective complexity, order, and disorder as organizing principles in the comparison of various generative art systems. This inclusive view leads to the somewhat surprising observation that generative art is as old as art itself. A number of specific artists and studies are discussed within this systems and complexity theory influenced paradigm. Finally a number of art theoretical questions are introduced to exercise the suggested generative art definition and implicit paradigm.","author":[{"family":"Galanter","given":"Philip"}],"citation-key":"galanterWhatGenerativeArt","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"What is Generative Art?

A meditation on the act of listening and the nature of performance, Cage's controversial piece became the iconic statement of the meaning of silence in art and is a landmark work of American music. In this book, Kyle Gann, one of the nation's leading music critics, explains¡em¿4'33\"¡/em¿as a unique moment in American culture and musical composition. Finding resemblances and resonances of¡em¿4'33\"¡/em¿in artworks as wide-ranging as the paintings of the Hudson River School and the music of John Lennon and Yoko Ono, he provides much-needed cultural context for this fundamentally challenging and often misunderstood piece. Gann also explores Cage's craft, describing in illuminating detail the musical, philosophical, and even environmental influences that informed this groundbreaking piece of music. Having performed¡em¿4'33\"¡/em¿himself and as a composer in his own right, Gann offers the reader both an expert's analysis and a highly personal interpretation of Cage's most divisive work.","author":[{"family":"Gann","given":"Kyle"}],"citation-key":"Gann2010","ISBN":"978-0-300-13699-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"title":"No such thing as silence","type":"book","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1np6sj"},

Thus far the algorithmic basis of this process is unknown and there exists no artificial system with similar capabilities. However, in other key areas of visual perception such as object and face recognition near-human performance was recently demonstrated by a class of biologically inspired vision models called Deep Neural Networks. Here we introduce an artificial system based on a Deep Neural Network that creates artistic images of high perceptual quality. The system uses neural representations to separate and recombine content and style of arbitrary images, providing a neural algorithm for the creation of artistic images. Moreover, in light of the striking similarities between performance-optimised artificial neural networks and biological vision, our work offers a path forward to an algorithmic understanding of how humans create and perceive artistic imagery.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Gatys","given":"Leon A."},{"family":"Ecker","given":"Alexander S."},{"family":"Bethge","given":"Matthias"}],"citation-key":"gatysNeuralAlgorithmArtistic2015","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.1508.06576","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",9,2]]},"number":"arXiv:1508.06576","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576"},

  {"id":"geisslerPsychoacousticInvestigationsPossibility2003","abstract":"Is it possible to make sound copies of violins?” To answer this question one needs to know the ingredients which make two violins judged by musicians to be aurally identical. Using a questionnaire among 54 musicians verbal attributes related to sound quality characteristics of violins were collected and ranked. Subjective listening tests were carried out to check which verbal attributes are suitable and do evoke the same meaning in different persons. Useful attributes for the ranking could be found using statistical measures for consistency and concordance. Additionally, it was found that the measurement uncertainty of frequency response measurements today is smaller than the analysis resolution of the human ear in regard to frequency and amplitude in the frequency range important for the hearing sensation and for room acoustic situations typical for a violin maker’s workshop. The results give strong indications that the psychoacoustics characteristics of the human ear and the vibroacoustic characteristics of the violin body in combination with the attributes judged to be important for violin sound quality will in principle allow for the idea of making sound copies of a given violin.","author":[{"family":"Geißler","given":"Paul"}],"citation-key":"geisslerPsychoacousticInvestigationsPossibility2003","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Psychoacoustic Investigations on the Possibility of Aurally Identical Violins","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"gerchunouParadojaPopulista2020","abstract":"While economic theory indicates that macroeconomic populism is doomed to failure, history shows that populist experiences are frequently repeated, ignoring both theory and past failures. In this article, we explore the origin of this paradox: why a strategy that is considered inconsistent and, therefore, doomed to failure, is adopted by governments? The “populist paradox” represents a challenge to general equilibrium frameworks based on purely rational behavior. Our explanation is that there are situations in which governments face a strong tension between two policy objectives: macroeconomic balance and social peace. This type of situation can be analytically characterized as a case of structural disequilibrium that occurs when there is a structural distributive conﬂict: a tension between social demands and the productive capacity of the economy. The economic policy strategies that prefers the objective of social peace over macroeconomic balance are what the literature calls “populist”. The repeated implementation of this type of strategies arises from the social pressure to satisfy popular demands. To illustrate and give historical background to our hypothesis, we use the Argentine economic history. As a solution to this type of conﬂicts, we oﬀer some guidelines of a tentative strategy based on a social agreement that includes the possibility of trading income for equity between labor and capital.","author":[{"family":"Gerchunoǘ","given":"Pablo"},{"family":"Rapetti","given":"Martín"}],"citation-key":"gerchunouParadojaPopulista2020","container-title":"DESARROLLO ECONÓMICO.

  {"id":"gersonObjectRelationsPsychoanalysis2004","abstract":"This article examines the political contents of object relations psychoanalysis, a theory that perceives dependence as the natural state of all humans. Unlike the views advanced by the classical state‐of‐nature models of Locke, Hobbes, and Rousseau, object relations perceives humans in their original state as already grouped and driven by an urge to associate. Company (rather than privacy, property, or political participation) stands out as the basic right, and all the other rights follow on it as instruments for fulfilling it. The primacy of care lends itself to the justification of distributive measures meant to bolster family cohesion and individual confidence at the expense of the open market. The theory is therefore compatible with the premises of the social‐democratic welfare state.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Gerson","given":"Gal"}],"citation-key":"gersonObjectRelationsPsychoanalysis2004","container-title":"Political Psychology","container-title-short":"Political Psychology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1467-9221.2004.00397.x","ISSN":"0162-895X, 1467-9221","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",10]]},"language":"en","page":"769-794","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Object Relations Psychoanalysis as Political Theory","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9221.2004.00397.x","volume":"25"},

The conference was also an occasion to listen to some critical voices on the usefulness of the taxonomical approach in today's digital era; and, in particular, on questions regarding the hierarchical structure and the problems posed by the class of electrophones, which Hornbostel and Sachs never developed.

  {"id":"gibsonSelfBorrowingsInstrumentalMusic2006","abstract":"As one of the most important composers of the twentieth century, Iannis Xenakis is also known for having used mathematical models in his compositions and for developing a formalization of music. But Xenakis’s compositional processes did not rely only on mathematics. Like many other composers, he borrowed extensively from his own works. These borrowings, which cannot be properly regarded as self-quotations, did not always relate to theoretical problems. Most of the time, they were selected for their particular sonic qualities or transformed in order to create new ones. This presentation examines the extent of self-borrowing in the music of Iannis Xenakis and shows how the composer made use of montage techniques as a means of producing different kinds of objects or textures.","author":[{"family":"Gibson","given":"Benoît"}],"citation-key":"gibsonSelfBorrowingsInstrumentalMusic2006","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Self-Borrowings in the Instrumental Music of Iannis Xenakis","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"gigerVerdiFrenchAesthetic2008","abstract":"Focusing on Verdi's French operas, Giger shows how the composer acquired an ever better understanding of the various approaches to French versification while gradually bringing his works in line with French melodic aesthetic. In his first French opera, Jérusalem, Verdi treated the text in an overly cautious manner, trying to avoid prosodic mistakes; in Les Vêpres siciliennes he began to apply more freedom, scanning the verses against some prosodic accents to convey the lightheartedness of a melody; and in Don Carlos he finally drew on the entire palette of prosodic interpretations. Most of Verdi's melodic accomplishments in the French operas carried over into the subsequent Italian ones, setting the stage for what later would be called operatic verismo. Drawing attention to the significance of the libretto for the development of nineteenth-century French and Italian opera, this text illustrates Verdi's gradual mastery of the challenges he faced, and their historical significance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Giger","given":"Andreas"}],"citation-key":"gigerVerdiFrenchAesthetic2008","DOI":"10.1017/CBO9780511481390","edition":"1","ISBN":"978-0-521-87843-2 978-0-521-34954-3 978-0-511-48139-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",6,9]]},"language":"en","license":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Verdi and the French Aesthetic: Verse, Stanza, and Melody in Nineteenth-Century Opera","title-short":"Verdi and the French Aesthetic","type":"book","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/9780511481390/type/book"},
  {"id":"giglioPerformanceBasedDesignApproach2020","abstract":"The acoustics of architecture has a large inﬂuence on the physical and psychological state of people, impacting on their communication, concentration and behaviour. Nevertheless, the sound issues of the interior of common spaces are often faced in the last stage of the design process, as an accurate acoustic design requires a high level of expertise. Owners, companies, public administration, and so on face this issue by selecting off-the-shelf acoustic panels or furniture, which might not always respond to the acoustic requirements, speciﬁc for each space. This leads to unsatisfying acoustic conditions, consequently increasing the initial investment. Nowadays, a new awareness on the topic of architectural acoustics design has pushed towards ﬁnding new integrated methodologies able to deliver tailored solutions for the design with sound, which embed performance criteria early in the design phase by means of simulation and computational techniques. This paper describes a workﬂow developed in the frame of the research project: “EcoAcustica. Sustainable and innovative surfaces for adaptive acoustics”, aimed at creating acoustic surfaces and customised to improve the interior acoustics in a global geometry scale. The design of the new ABC Department Digital Fabrication Lab at Politecnico di Milano is used as a case study for the proposed methodology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Giglio","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Paoletti","given":"Ingrid"},{"family":"Zheliazkova","given":"Maia"}],"citation-key":"giglioPerformanceBasedDesignApproach2020","container-title":"Digital Transformation of the Design, Construction and Management Processes of the Built Environment","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-030-33570-0_13","editor":[{"family":"Daniotti","given":"Bruno"},{"family":"Gianinetto","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Della Torre","given":"Stefano"}],"event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-030-33569-4 978-3-030-33570-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","page":"137-148","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Performance-Based Design Approach for Tailored Acoustic Surfaces","type":"chapter","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-030-33570-0_13"},

The investigation of the design of meaningful ways to convey musical information via the sense of touch is a paramount step toward achieving truly transparent haptic-augmented interfaces for music performance and practice, and in this chapter we present our recent work in this context. We start by deﬁning a model for haptic-augmented interfaces for music, and a taxonomy of vibrotactile feedback and stimulation, which we use to categorize a brief literature review on the topic. We then present the design and evaluation of a haptic language of cues in the form of tactile icons delivered via vibrotactile-equipped wearable garments. This language constitutes the base of a “wearable score” used in music performance and practice. We provide design guidelines for our tactile icons and user-based evaluations to assess their effectiveness in delivering musical information and report on the system’s implementation in a live musical performance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Giordano","given":"Marcello"},{"family":"Sullivan","given":"John"},{"family":"Wanderley","given":"Marcelo M."}],"citation-key":"giordanoDesignVibrotactileFeedback2018","container-title":"Musical Haptics","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-319-58316-7_10","editor":[{"family":"Papetti","given":"Stefano"},{"family":"Saitis","given":"Charalampos"}],"event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-319-58315-0 978-3-319-58316-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","page":"193-214","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Design of Vibrotactile Feedback and Stimulation for Music Performance","type":"chapter","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-58316-7_10"},

Noise seems to stand for a lack of aesthetic grace, to alienate or distract rather than enrapture. And yet the drones of psychedelia, the racket of garage rock and punk, the thudding of rave, the feedback of shoegaze and post-rock, the bombast of thrash and metal, the clatter of jungle and the stuttering of electronica, together with notable examples of avant-garde noise art, have all found a place in the history of contemporary musics, and are recognised as representing key evolutionary moments. Noise therefore is the untold story of contemporary popular music, and in a critical exploration of noise lies the possibility of a new narrative: one that is wide-ranging, connects the popular to the underground and avant-garde, fully posits the studio as a musical instrument, and demands new critical and theoretical paradigms of those seeking to write about music.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,23]]},"citation-key":"goddardResonancesNoiseContemporary2013","DOI":"10.5040/9781501382833","edition":"1","editor":[{"family":"Goddard","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Halligan","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Spelman","given":"Nicola"}],"ISBN":"978-1-5013-8283-3 978-1-4411-5937-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Bloomsbury Academic","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Resonances: Noise and Contemporary Music","title-short":"Resonances","type":"book","URL":"https://www.bloomsburycollections.com/monograph?docid=b-9781501382833"},
  {"id":"goddardSemanticFieldworkLexical2014","abstract":"The main goal of paper is to show how NSM findings about lexical universals (semantic primes) can be applied to semantic analysis in little-described languages. It is argued that using lexical universals as a vocabulary for semantic analysis allows one to formulate meaning descriptions that are rigorous, cognitively authentic, maximally translatable, and free from Anglocentrism. A second goal is to shed light on methodological issues in semantic fieldwork by interrogating some controversial claims about the Dalabon and Pirahã languages. We argue that reductive paraphrase into lexical universals provides a practical procedure for arriving at coherent interpretations of unfamiliar lexical meanings. Other indigenous/endangered languages discussed include East Cree, Arrernte, Kayardild, Karuk, and Maori. We urge field linguists to take the NSM metalanguage, based on lexical universals, into the field with them, both as an aid to lexicogrammatical documentation and analysis and as a way to improve semantic communication with consultants.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Goddard","given":"Cliff"},{"family":"Wierzbicka","given":"Anna"}],"citation-key":"goddardSemanticFieldworkLexical2014","container-title":"Studies in Language","container-title-short":"SL","DOI":"10.1075/sl.38.1.03god","ISSN":"0378-4177, 1569-9978","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"80-127","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Semantic fieldwork and lexical universals","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jbe-platform.com/content/journals/10.1075/sl.38.1.03god","volume":"38"},

  {"id":"gornySpaceTechnicityTheorisingSocial2024","abstract":"Desperate times demand optimistic transdisciplinary measures. This volume unites a select group of thinkers who courageously traverse disciplinary boundaries. What brings them together is the least stratified ‘component’: a shared problem. It is a widely recognised that a problem gets the solution it merits. However, only a few acknowledge that a problem seldom neatly fits within a single discipline, nor does it conform to the principle of general equivalence. Handling its irreducibility and non-entailment is a skill possessed by very few. Even fewer take the quasi-causal capacity of what we term the ‘space of technicity’ seriously.  The space of technicity, the shared problem of this volume, is a consequence of immanence. Each configuration of surfaces comprising the built environment produces an intangible effect, acting as a quasi-cause. It can be referred to as downward causation or the timely rediscovery of (neo)finalism.  In this volume it is approached it from the perspective of axiology. The space of technicity allows us to evade techno-determinism without adopting an anything-goes attitude. That which has become manifest could have individuated differently. However, the potential of a body cannot be discerned before intervening in the causal fabric of agential reality to extract the singular points that make certain outcomes more likely than others, surpassing mere probability.  When operating within the ethico-aesthetic paradigm, where sense becomes intricately dependent on sensibility, and vice versa, the volume’s attitude might be said to approximate the Spinozian third kind of knowledge that intuits design (and its space of technicity) beyond mere imagination or reason.

  {"id":"grahamInversorInteligente1949","abstract":"Considerado el más importante consejero en inversión del siglo XX, Benjamin Graham enseñó e inspiró a financieros de todo el mundo. Presentó su filosofía, basada en el concepto de «invertir en valor», en «El inversor inteligente», un libro que se convirtió en la biblia de los inversores ya desde su primera publicación en 1949. En él, Benjamin Graham alerta a los inversores sobre cómo evitar errores de estrategia, al tiempo que describe cómo desarrollar un plan racional para comprar acciones y aumentar su valor. Todo ello pensando en el largo plazo, pues trata de un método dirigido a inversores y no a especuladores: mientras que el especulador sólo tiene en cuenta las tendencias del mercado, el inversor obtiene sus beneficios con base en la disciplina y la investigación. Con el paso de los años, el mercado ha ido dando la razón a todas y a cada una de las estrategias planteadas por Benjamin Graham, cuya obra sigue siendo una referencia ineludible. Esta edición, además, cuenta con la valiosa aportación del periodista financiero Jason Zweig, quien se ha encargado de comentar y actualizar el texto, trazando paralelismos entre los ejemplos aportados por Benjamin Graham y las situaciones reales vividas en el mundo de las finanzas en los últimos años. «El inversor inteligente», además de ser un clásico imprescindible en cualquier biblioteca que se precie, es uno de los libros más importantes que se pueden leer para alcanzar los objetivos financieros que cada inversor se haya marcado.","author":[{"family":"Graham","given":"Benjamin"}],"citation-key":"grahamInversorInteligente1949","issued":{"date-parts":[["1949",1,1]]},"language":"es","note":"Item ID: _:n15","publisher":"ePubLibre","title":"El inversor inteligente","type":"book"},

  {"id":"Grant1993","abstract":"Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy bynhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.","author":[{"family":"Grant","given":"Kenneth"}],"citation-key":"Grant1993","container-title":"Skoob Books","ISBN":"9781119130536","issued":{"date-parts":[["1993"]]},"title":"Aleister crowley and the hidden god","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"grauFilosofiaComoBellas1995","abstract":"La filosofía académica a veces olvida que su disciplina no fue casi nunca completamente autónoma y diferenciada, sino una reflexión suscitada en el curso mismo de los intereses morales, estéticos científicos y políticos. Lo que los filósofos hacen no es algo completamente ajeno a lo que son los hombres, o sus intereses o sus preocupaciones. Una filosofía considerada como arte —más en concreto: como acción retórica teatral— está en mejores condiciones que la elucubración monológica para comprender la vida de la que surge y a la que debe ayudar a aclararse. La fuerza de una filosofía bien relacionada con los demás saberes humanísticos, entendida como el arte de trabar y remitir, establecer vecindades y tejer vectores de sentido, logra ampliar el espacio situado entre la excesiva abstracción académica y la inmediatez irreflexiva. Esa atención medida, el equilibrio entre ingenuidad y estilo, la fuerza polémica aliada con la flexibilidad del temple humorístico, son lo que permiten entender la filosofía como arte. Un filósofo así entendido no sería nada parecido a un funcionario de la humanidad, a un fontanero de la historia o a un mecánico del gran curso del mundo, sino alguien que trata de indagar en la cultura poniendo en ejercicio una razón que es ingenua, narrativa, discursiva y cómica.

The latter is a direct outgrowth of the potential inherent in what networks actually are and of a sense of social cohesion based on uniformity and standardization. The discovery that this style of computer music-making can be effectively used as a curricular tool has also deeply affected the evolution and approaches of many in the field.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Gresham-Lancaster","given":"Scot"}],"citation-key":"gresham-lancasterPersonalReminiscenceRoots2017","container-title":"Leonardo Music Journal","container-title-short":"Leonardo Music Journal","DOI":"10.1162/LMJ_a_01022","ISSN":"0961-1215, 1531-4812","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",12]]},"language":"en","page":"71-77","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A Personal Reminiscence on the Roots of Computer Network Music","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://direct.mit.edu/lmj/article/69477","volume":"27"},

A three-dimensional scaling solution, well matching the clustering analysis, was found to be interpretable in terms of (1) the spectral energy distribution; (2) the presence of synchronicity in the transients of the higher harmonics, along with the closely related amount of spectral fluctuation within the the tone through time; and (3) the presence of low-amplitude, high-frequency energy in the initial attack segment; an alternate interpretation of the latter two dimensions viewed the cylindrical distribution of clusters of stimulus points about the spectral energy distribution, grouping on the basis of musical instrument family (with two exceptions).

We begin by making the case for a consideration of games as systems of social rationality, akin to other modern systems such as capitalist markets and bureaucratic organizations. We then present a conceptualization of play as a process through which the player focuses attention away from the undifferentiated action of everyday life toward a differentiated sphere of playful activity. This approach reveals how the experience of play changes as it becomes rationalized through the technological mediation and widespread standardization that occurs as games become largescale social practices. We propose a theory of the rationalization of play (ludiﬁcation), which outlines the key components of socially rationalized games, which we then apply to the speciﬁc example of massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Grimes","given":"Sara M."},{"family":"Feenberg","given":"Andrew"}],"citation-key":"grimesRationalizingPlayCritical2009","container-title":"The Information Society","container-title-short":"The Information Society","DOI":"10.1080/01972240802701643","ISSN":"0197-2243, 1087-6537","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",3,11]]},"language":"en","page":"105-118","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Rationalizing Play: A Critical Theory of Digital Gaming","title-short":"Rationalizing Play","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01972240802701643","volume":"25"},
  {"id":"grimesWhatSenseCan2014","abstract":"My recent work is an exploration of the physical and conceptual mechanisms that interface people with instruments. Central to this investigation is a conception of the performer/instrument assemblage as a symbiosis of two parallel and interdependent systems: one – the performer – moves through space established by the other – the instrument. Each system possesses its own intrinsic properties and characteristics; each possesses capacities to affect and be affected by one another. The music emanates from this contiguous interaction. Instrument surface is understood as a compositional resource itself, a topological façade, defined by ordinal distances, that guides gestures along its contours. Within these fluctuating constellations of spatial coordinates, I consider all the relevant ways a body can move, and establish some general combinatory rules that inform the convergence of forces within the body. The traditional subjects of compositional contemplation such as form, duration, dynamic, etc. are not attributing features to the work per se but emerge as results from spatiotemporal relations of (bodily) movement’s correspondence with (instrumental) surface and mechanism. This liberation of movement is understood as a liberation of timbre, and the inherent indeterminacy of this relationship is embraced. As such, I would hypothesize that sound is, to an extent, freed from the subtractive tendencies of perception that might otherwise subvert it into generalized typological categories. Once liberated from the imagination, sound can bypass the brain and directly engage the nervous system.","author":[{"family":"Grimes","given":"Alex"}],"citation-key":"grimesWhatSenseCan2014","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"In What Sense Can Instruments and Bodies be said to Form Spaces?","type":"thesis"},

  {"id":"Groys2008","abstract":"En la actualidad, el término \" arte contemporáneo \" no designa sólo al arte que es producido en nuestro tiempo. El arte contemporáneo de nuestros días más bien demuestra cómo lo contemporáneo se expone a sí mismo (el acto de presentar el presente). En ese sentido, el arte contemporáneo es diferente del arte Moderno, que se dirigió hacia el futuro, y diferente también del Postmoderno, que es una reflexión histórica sobre el proyecto Moderno. El \" arte contemporáneo \" contemporáneo privilegia el presente con respecto al futuro o el pasado. Por lo tanto, para caracterizar adecuadamente a la naturaleza del arte contemporáneo, parece pertinente situarlo en su relación con el proyecto Moderno y su re-evaluación Postmodernista. La idea central del arte Moderno fue la de creatividad. El genuino artista Moderno estaba supuesto a efectuar una ruptura radical con el pasado, a borrar, destruir el pasado, alcanzar ese punto cero de la tradición artística y, al hacerlo, darle un nuevo comienzo a un nuevo futuro. La obra de arte mimética y tradicional fue sometida al trabajo iconoclasta y destructivo del análisis y la reducción. Abolir las tradiciones, romper con las convenciones, destruir el viejo arte y erradicar los valores obsoletos fueron los slogans del momento. La práctica de la vanguardia histórica estuvo basada en la ecuación \" negación es creación \" , que ya había sido enunciada por Bakunin, Stirner y Nietzsche. Las imágenes iconoclastas de la destrucción y la reducción estuvieron destinadas a servir como iconos del futuro. El artista estaba supuesto a encarnar el \" activo nihilismo \" de la nada (nothingness) que lo originaba todo. Pero ¿cómo un artista individual podría probar que era, en realidad, genuinamente creativo? Obviamente un artista podría mostrarlo sólo al demostrar cuán lejos había llegado en la destrucción y reducción de la imagen tradicional, cuán iconoclasta y radical era su trabajo.

  {"id":"Groys2016","abstract":"El poder lo tiene el que domina los lenguajes. Sobre los lenguajes como reproducción, creación y simulación de la realidad. La situación intelectual y cultural de nuestra época se considera generalmente pluralista, tolerante y permisiva. Según esta opinión ampliamente extendida la actual cultura occidental no ofrece al hombre criterios generales y vinculantes que le capacitarían para escoger entre la multitud de ideologías, doctrinas, teorías, proyectos políticos o tendencias artísticas, etc. que, conviviendo en una especie de \"coexistencia pacífica\", se recelan mutuamente. Cada una de estas corrientes ideológicas suele reclamar su propia verdad última. En un nivel teórico, todas en el fondo se excluyen recíprocamente. Ya no existen criterios de selección independientes de las teorías. Por ello las decisiones se toman más o menos por casualidad o arbitrariamente. Pero este hecho descalifica a su vez las exigencias de verdad de todas las teorías. Incluso niega de hecho la función de la razón teórica como algo fundamental Esta situación se valora naturalmente de forma distinta: unos la saludan como expresión de la emancipación, liberalidad y tolerancia, que, por motivos morales, es preferible a la exigencia exagerada de la razón. Desde un punto de vista religioso, esta calificación incluso podría justificarse dentro del marco de una teología negativa o apofántica, a saber, como reconocimiento de la limitación ontológica de la razón humana, que por este motivo exige el respeto de la voluntad y la verdad ocultas de Dios. Otras lamentan, sin embargo, el pluralismo contemporáneo y ven en él el dominio del cinismo y de la \"tolerancia represiva\", una perenne reiteración absurda del statu quo, que no suministra orientación para la actuación del hombre y que, al contrario, le condena a lo facultativo y la arbitrariedad. La polémica entre las valoraciones positivas y negativas de la actual situación domina ampliamente las discusiones intelectuales del momento. Pero debajo de esta polémica se oculta – como decíamos – un consenso sobre el diagnóstico fundamental acerca de la configuración de esta situación. Existe consenso acerca de su condición pluralista y facultativa. Ahora bien, parece que precisamente esta caracterización sea cuestionable. Se opone a mis experiencias y mis observaciones en el trato con las empresas culturales modernas. Estas empresas – como cualquier empresa – obligan al rendimiento, al éxito, crean determinadas reglas y establecen determinados criterios según los cuales se evalúa el rendimiento y el éxito. Sin duda el criterio más importante es la exigencia de originalidad. Cualquiera que pretenda triunfar en la vida cultural actual, en el ámbito que sea, tropieza con esta exigencia. Un artista sólo es reconocido si demuestra que su obra es original, nueva, \"creativa\". Para el científico es lo mismo. Tiene que establecer una teoría original y personal, por lo nimia que sea, para poder ser alguien en el mundo de la ciencia. A los diseñadores de moda, los políticos y otras víctimas de la exigencia de innovación los respetaré por ahora en mi enumeración. La exigencia de ser original e innovador es, sin embargo todo menos tolerante o permisiva. Precisamente no permite a los productores de cultura elegir entre las corrientes ideológicas y artísticas existentes, sino que hasta excluye esta posibilidad. La obligación de estar informado acerca de la oferta en el ámbito cultural no significa que el creador pueda escoger libremente lo que le parece, sino que debe evitar todo lo que pueda levantar la sospecha de que no es original. La pluralidad de las actitudes métodos y teorías culturales ofrecidas no es, por tanto, expresión de una","author":[{"family":"Groys","given":"Boris"}],"citation-key":"Groys2016","ISBN":"978-987-1622-49-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"page":"211","publisher":"Caja Negra","title":"Arte en flujo","type":"book"},

  {"id":"Groys2019","abstract":"Recordemos la conocida frase de Joseph Beuys: \"Todo ser humano es un artista\". Esta máxima tiene una larga tradición que se remonta al marxismo temprano y a la vanguardia rusa. Lo que se entendía en ese momento como utopía se ha convertido hoy en una obligación: todo ser humano tiene que asumir una responsabilidad estética por su apariencia frente al mundo, por el diseño de sí. Aunque no todos producen obras, todos son una obra. A fines del siglo XX, el arte entró en una nueva era: la de la producción artística masiva. Mientras que el anterior fue un período signado por el consumo masivo del arte, en nuestra época la situación se modificó al compás de los avances técnicos y de los cambios en los criterios que utilizamos para identificar qué es arte y qué no lo es. El acceso relativamente fácil a variados dispositivos para la producción de imágenes combinado con Internet como plataforma de distribución global alteró la relación tradicional entre productores y espectadores: las redes sociales y los sitios como Facebook, Twitter, YouTube y Second Life ofrecen a la población global la oportunidad de mostrar sus fotos, videos y textos de un modo que no puede distinguirse de cualquier otra obra de arte conceptualista o post-conceptualista. Asistimos a la sustitución del campo unificado de la cultura de masas por un escenario de fragmentación en el que millones de prnductores generan textos e imágenes para un espectador que no tiene suficiente tiempo -para leer y ver. En los ensayos que componen Volverse público, Boris Groys describe diversos aspectos de esta transformación radical del campo del arte, desde sus manifestaciones embrionarias en los proyectos de artistas de vanguardia como Duchamp, Kandinsky y Malevich hasta la actualidad, en la que la actividad artística pareciera no ser más un destino exclusivo sino un gesto débil, una tarea que asumimos cotidianamente en el nuevo ágora mediática.","author":[{"family":"Groys","given":"Boris"}],"citation-key":"Groys2019","ISBN":"978-987-1622-30-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"page":"208","title":"Volverse público","type":"book"},

  {"id":"gubernHistoriaCine1968","abstract":"Esta Historia del cine, de Román Gubern, aparecida en dos volúmenes en 1969, ha sido traducida y repetidamente editada, en versiones sucesivamente revisadas, hasta 2001, convirtiéndose en un referente clásico sobre esta materia, utilizado como texto docente en muchas universidades, como obra de consulta o como relato ameno de la historia del nacimiento de un nuevo arte y medio de comunicación audiovisual que ha configurado un nuevo lenguaje artístico, un imaginario colectivo, un moldeador de costumbres sociales, un medio de propaganda ideológica y una forma de entretenimiento masivo. Agotada a lo largo de más de una década, esta obra reaparece ahora en una versión revisada, actualizada y en un nuevo formato. En ella se describe la historia de un espectáculo popular que nació como una derivación de la instantánea fotográfica gracias al ingenio de inventores e industriales del siglo XIX (Edison y Lumière), creció en barracas de feria o espectáculos de music hall y llegó a convertirse en fábrica de sueños colectivos en templos de mármol y de suntuosos cortinajes, para recluirse luego en minisalas, pantallas de televisión o en soportes informáticos. El libro describe tanto su evolución estética, como forma artística de la modernidad occidental que ha influido profundamente en otras artes, como su evolución técnica y sus implicaciones socioeconómicas e ideológicas. Agente activo de propaganda política ya desde la guerra de Cuba (1898), la de los bóxers en China (1899-1901) y la ruso-japonesa (1904-1905), supo entablar un fructífero diálogo con los movimientos de vanguardia del siglo XX e inscribirse en las revoluciones estéticas e intelectuales desarrolladas a lo largo de más de un siglo. Pero de su diversificada cantera imaginativa surgieron también historias de aventuras en parajes exóticos, dramas amorosos, sátiras del poder político o económico, gestas heroicas y tenebrosas intrigas criminales. Por no mencionar sus arquetipos de atractivo erótico y sus modelos de seducción, que influirían en los gustos de las masas.","author":[{"family":"Gubern","given":"Román"}],"citation-key":"gubernHistoriaCine1968","issued":{"date-parts":[["1968",12,31]]},"language":"es","note":"Item ID: _:n29","publisher":"ePubLibre","title":"Historia del cine","type":"book"},

En Máscaras de la ficción Gubern elige medio centenar de personajes creados en los últimos dos siglos y traza, a partir de ellos, la mitología moderna de la ficción. Agrupados de acuerdo a ejes temáticos tales como la culpa, los sueños, la derrota y el doble, personajes aparentemente tan disímiles como el monstruo de Frankenstein, Carmen, Sherlock Holmes, Lulú, el doctor Jekyll, Pinocho, Alicia, Flash Gordon, Lolita, Ahab, Superman, Dorian Gray, el doctor Caligari, el Zorro, Drácula e Indiana Jones, entre muchos otros, son traídos a la palestra para ser vistos desde una luz un poco distinta, revelando así en sus mitos respectivos (que por archiconocidos creíamos diáfanos y quizás agotados), matices que ayudan no sólo a comprenderlos mejor, sino a comprender mejor el mundo y el momento histórico en que vivieron los hombres y mujeres que los produjeron. Máscaras de la ficción es un libro con riqueza de enfoques y abundancia de aciertos, en el que la hermenéutica seguida arroja una inquietante luz que ilumina no pocos claroscuros de la mitología postcontemporánea y que permite entender nuestros modelos de conducta y los resortes de nuestra fantasía y, por ello, los componentes mitopoéticos en que se funda nuestra realidad.

These artistic and cultural examples are considered critical concepts that enhance and interrupt the philosophical discourse. The article argues that Stiegler’s aesthetics is committed to the capacity that art, as a technology of the spirit, can contribute as agency in shaping public power, even when these agents are not directly in conflict and develop lesser and fragile performative technics through which a memory becomes present again.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Guerra Miranda","given":"Luis"}],"citation-key":"guerramirandaBernardStieglersPostfoundational2024","container-title":"Aisthesis.

In this paper, a thin functionally-graded acoustic metamaterial sound absorber is presented and discussed. In this paper, it is shown that the proposed design can attain an absorption coeﬃcient near unity, which implies that the acoustic metamaterial sound absorber must simultaneously possess near zero reﬂectance and transmittance over a given frequency band. To achieve this, the acoustic metamaterial structure consists of a multilayer arrangement of an interwoven sonic crystal lattice with varying ﬁlling fractions, backed by a thin elastic coating that acts as a ﬂexural acoustic element. The overall thickness of the sound absorber is about one tenth of the wavelength in air, and it was fabricated using additive manufacturing (3D printing) with a thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU). Samples were fabricated and acoustically tested in an air-ﬁlled acoustic impedance tube to determine absorption and eﬀective acoustic properties. A theoretical formulation for the eﬀective acoustic properties of the interwoven sonic crystal lattice was used to guide the design process, and good agreement was found between measured and theoretically predicted results. A range of ﬁlling fractions and thicknesses were tested to verify the fabrication process and robustness of the modeling, and both were found to be in excellent agreement.","author":[{"family":"Guild","given":"Matthew D"},{"family":"Rohde","given":"Charles A"}],"citation-key":"guild3DPrintedAcoustic2018","container-title":"Conference Proceedings","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"3D printed acoustic metamaterial sound absorbers using functionally-graded sonic crystals","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"haffterMusikalischerMaterialismusPhilosophie2023","abstract":"Zeitgenössische Musik ist fragwürdige Musik. Sie zieht sich selbst in Zweifel. Eine Philosophie solcher Musik muss diesen Zweifel aufnehmen und fragen, wie Musik heute als Kunst möglich ist. Sie muss die Bedingungen und Problemhintergründe, die begrifflichen Grundlagen und technischen Potenziale der gegenwärtigen Musikproduktion durchdenken. In Auseinandersetzung mit aktuellen Fragen der Komposition und Kunsttheorie erarbeitet Christoph Haffter eine Konzeption des musikalischen Werks, die es an das ästhetische Urteil und an die historischen Tendenzen des Materials bindet. Sie verknüpft auf diese Weise Einsichten der philosophischen Ästhetik im Ausgang von Immanuel Kant mit den kritischen Einwänden des historischen Materialismus in der Nachfolge von Karl Marx und greift darin das Programm der Musikphilosophie Theodor W. Adornos wieder auf. Für diese Verbindung von Musikästhetik und kritischer Reflexion der Gegenwart steht der Begriff eines Musikalischen Materialismus.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Haffter","given":"Christoph"}],"citation-key":"haffterMusikalischerMaterialismusPhilosophie2023","DOI":"10.5771/9783748915300","ISBN":"978-3-7489-1530-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"de","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","publisher":"Velbrück Wissenschaft","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Musikalischer Materialismus: Eine Philosophie der zeitgenössischen Musik","title-short":"Musikalischer Materialismus","type":"book","URL":"https://www.nomos-elibrary.de/index.php?doi=10.5771/9783748915300"},
  {"id":"haidtAnxiousGenerationHow2024","abstract":"\"From New York Times bestselling coauthor of The Coddling of the American Mind, an essential investigation into the collapse of youth mental health-and a plan for a healthier, freer childhood After more than a decade of stability or improvement, the mental health of adolescents plunged in the early 2010s. Rates of depression, anxiety, self-harm, and suicide rose sharply, more than doubling on most measures. Why? In The Anxious Generation, social psychologist Jonathan Haidt lays out the facts about the epidemic of teen mental illness that hit many countries at the same time. He then investigates the nature of childhood, including why children need play and independent exploration to mature into competent, thriving adults. Haidt shows how the \"play-based childhood\" began to decline in the 1980s, and how it was finally wiped out by the arrival of the \"phone-based childhood\" in the early 2010s. He presents more than a dozen mechanisms by which this \"great rewiring of childhood\" has interfered with children's social and neurological development, covering everything from sleep deprivation to attention fragmentation, addiction, loneliness, social contagion, social comparison, and perfectionism. He explains why social media damages girls more than boys and why boys have been withdrawing from the real world into the virtual world, with disastrous consequences for themselves, their families, and their societies. Most important, Haidt issues a clear call to action. He diagnoses the \"collective action problems\" that trap us, and then proposes four simple rules that might set us free. He describes steps that parents, teachers, schools, tech companies, and governments can take to end the epidemic of mental illness and restore a more humane childhood. Haidt has spent his career speaking truth backed by data in the most difficult landscapes-communities polarized by politics and religion, campuses battling culture wars, and now the public health emergency faced by Gen Z. We cannot afford to ignore his findings about protecting our children-and ourselves-from the psychological damage of a phone-based life\"--","author":[{"family":"Haidt","given":"Jonathan"}],"call-number":"HQ792.U5 H23 2024","citation-key":"haidtAnxiousGenerationHow2024","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-0-593-65503-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"number-of-pages":"385","publisher":"Penguin Press","publisher-place":"New York","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"The anxious generation: how the great rewiring of childhood is causing an epidemic of mental illness","title-short":"The anxious generation","type":"book"},

Heterogeneous cultural contents are brought together side by side, like the fusion food that makes free use of all that the hypercultural pool of spices, ingredients and ways of preparing food has to offer. Culture is becoming un-bound, un-restricted, un-ravelled: a hyperculture. It is profoundly rhizomatic culture of intense hybridization, fusion and co-appropriation.

Hypercultural tourists travel in the hyperspace of events, a space of cultural sight-seeing. They experience culture as cul-tour.

  {"id":"hardjowirogoInstrumentalityConstructionInstrumental2017","abstract":"The musical instruments of the 21st century and those of earlier times differ in many respects, be it their appearance, their technical functionality, their playing technique, or their sounds. And as they have changed, so too have our understandings of what a musical instrument is. The lacking precision of the current notion of the instrument and its incompatibility with contemporary instrumental forms are consequences of a technocultural process that raises fundamental questions about the identity of the musical instrument: When (and why) is something a musical instrument—and when (and why) is it not? In order to grasp the slight differences between the yet-to-be-deﬁned instrumental and the assumed other, it seems reasonable to speak of instrumentality when denoting this particular speciﬁcity that instruments are supposed to feature. The present contribution seeks to prepare the ground for a reﬂective discussion on the concept of instrumentality and the underlying theoretical problem by considering not only the differences, but also the similarities between traditional and electronic musical instruments. Using a couple of different approaches to and views on the concept and deﬁning a number of criteria of instrumentality, it eventually yields a picture of musical instruments that connects the contemporary ones with those known for centuries.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Hardjowirogo","given":"Sarah-Indriyati"}],"citation-key":"hardjowirogoInstrumentalityConstructionInstrumental2017","container-title":"Musical Instruments in the 21st Century","DOI":"10.1007/978-981-10-2951-6_2","editor":[{"family":"Bovermann","given":"Till"},{"family":"De Campo","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Egermann","given":"Hauke"},{"family":"Hardjowirogo","given":"Sarah-Indriyati"},{"family":"Weinzierl","given":"Stefan"}],"event-place":"Singapore","ISBN":"978-981-10-2950-9 978-981-10-2951-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"en","page":"9-24","publisher":"Springer Singapore","publisher-place":"Singapore","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Instrumentality.

  {"id":"Harman2010","abstract":"1ª ed. Traducción de: Towards speculative realism. Essays and lectures. \"Cuando las piedras golpean contra la madera, cuando los ratos cósmicos desintegran a los protones, se nos dice que debemos dejar el asunto en manos de los físicos. La filosofía fue renunciando gradualmente a su pretensión de tener una relación directa con el mundo en sí, erigiéndose como el amo de ese solo intervalo que media entre el sujeto y el objeto, desde el que legisla en una secuencia interminable de paradojas y disputas partisianas. Pero, detrás de estas discusiones sin fin, la realidad se sigue moviendo. Los copos de nueve bailan bajo la luz que los aniquila sin piedad. Mientras lo filósofos se aporrean entre sí sobre la posibilidad del \"acceso\" al mundo, los tiburones persigen al atún y los glaciares golpean contra la costa. ¿Cuánto tiempo más la filosofía va a seguir satisfecha sin dirigirles la palabra? ¿Cuánto tiempo más vamos a encerrar juntos a los monos, los tornados y los diamantes bajo la etiqueta de \"lo que yace afuera\"? ¿Podría existir, en cambio, algo parecido a una filosofía orientada a objetos, una especie de alquimia capaz de describir las transformaciones de una entidad a otra, capaz de trazar las formas en las que las entidades seducen y destruyen a seres humanos y no humanos por igual?\" Representante anglosajón de la reciente corriente filosófica bautizada como realismo especulativo, Graham Harman explicita en este libro los alcances de dicho movimiento, a la vez que traza los lineamientos de su propio modelo dentro del mismo, la ontología orientada a objetos. Esta perspectiva promete superar los dilemas del acceso humano a la realidad en torno a los que han oribitado las filosofías de la conciencia y del lenguaje mediante un giro que recupera la especulación como vía de acceso al ser de las cosas. A partir de originales lecturas de autores como Heidegger, Whitehead, Ortega y Gasset, McLuhan, Bruno Latour, y Clement Greenberg, esta compilación de ensayos logra darnos una idea del alcance que esta novedosa aventura del pensamiento tieno no solo para la filosofía sino también para las ciencias sociales y la estética.","author":[{"family":"Harman","given":"Graham"}],"citation-key":"Harman2010","edition":"1a ed., 1a reimp","event-place":"Buenos Aires","ISBN":"978-987-1622-35-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"language":"es","page":"296","publisher":"Caja Negra","publisher-place":"Buenos Aires","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Hacia el realismo especulativo.

At the heart of this philosophy is the idea that objects - whether real, fictional, natural, artificial, human or non-human - are mutually autonomous.

  {"id":"harrisonWhenGuitarNot2018","abstract":"The design of traditional musical instruments is a process of incremental reﬁnement over many centuries of innovation. As a result, the shape and form of instruments are well established and recognised across cultures. Conversely, digital musical instruments (DMIs), being unconstrained by requirements of eﬃcient acoustic sound production and ergonomics, can take on forms which are more abstract in their relation to the mechanism of control and sound production. In this paper we consider the case of designing DMIs that resemble traditional instruments, and pose questions around the social and technical acceptability of certain design choices relating to physical form and input modality (sensing strategy and the input gestures that it aﬀords). We designed four guitar-derivative DMIs to be suitable for performing strummed harmonic accompaniments to a folk tune. Each instrument possesses a combination of one of two global forms (guitar-like body and a smaller tabletop enclosure) and one of two control mechanisms (physical strings and touch sensors).

  {"id":"havilJohnNapierLife2014","abstract":"John Napier (1550-1617) is celebrated today as the man who invented logarithms--an enormous intellectual achievement that would soon lead to the development of their mechanical equivalent in the slide rule: the two would serve humanity as the principal means of calculation until the mid-1970s. Yet, despite Napier's pioneering efforts, his life and work have not attracted detailed modern scrutiny. John Napier is the first contemporary biography to take an in-depth look at the multiple facets of Napier's story: his privileged position as the seventh Laird of Merchiston and the son of influential Scottish landowners; his reputation as a magician who dabbled in alchemy; his interest in agriculture; his involvement with a notorious outlaw; his staunch anti-Catholic beliefs; his interactions with such peers as Henry Briggs, Johannes Kepler, and Tycho Brahe; and, most notably, his estimable mathematical legacy. Julian Havil explores Napier's original development of logarithms, the motivations for his approach, and the reasons behind certain adjustments to them. Napier's inventive mathematical ideas also include formulas for solving spherical triangles, \"Napier's Bones\" (a more basic but extremely popular alternative device for calculation), and the use of decimal notation for fractions and binary arithmetic. Havil also considers Napier's study of the Book of Revelation, which led to his prediction of the Apocalypse in his first book, A Plaine Discovery of the Whole Revelation of St. John--the work for which Napier believed he would be most remembered. John Napier assesses one man's life and the lasting influence of his advancements on the mathematical sciences and beyond. --","author":[{"family":"Havil","given":"Julian"}],"call-number":"QA29.N2 H38 2014","citation-key":"havilJohnNapierLife2014","event-place":"Princeton","ISBN":"978-0-691-15570-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"language":"en","note":"OCLC: ocn877364301","number-of-pages":"279","publisher":"Princeton University Press","publisher-place":"Princeton","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"John napier: life, logarithms, and legacy","title-short":"John napier","type":"book"},

Aunque se considera principalmente economista, Hayek entiende que las respuestas a muchos de los acuciantes problemas de nuestro tiempo se basan en principios que caen fuera del campo de la técnica económica o de cualquier otra disciplina aislada.

  {"id":"hegelCienciaLogicaVol2017","abstract":"La presente traducción es la primera que se realizó en español de la Ciencia de la Lógica. Esta obra es conocida como «Gran Lógica» para distinguirla de la «Pequeña Lógica» o resumen incluido como primera parte de la Enciclopedia de las Ciencias Filosóficas. A pesar de ser una obra clave, que junto a la Fenomenología del Espíritu constituyen las partes más desarrolladas del «sistema de la ciencia» del autor, ha sido menos estudiada que el resumen de la Enciclopedia. Hasta el punto de que tanto bastantes seguidores como críticos apenas la han leído. La nueva lógica con la que Hegel quiere sustituir la tradicional, se plantea el problema procedente de la gnoseología kantiana, cuyo dualismo, de pensamiento y ser, cerraba el tránsito de nuestra conciencia de ser en sí (noúmeno). Hegel rechaza ese dualismo y el fantasma de lo incognoscible; el pensamiento es el ser o noúmeno verdadero. Sin embargo, debemos conocerlo; lo que no se logra con aceptar empíricamente las determinaciones del pensamiento, ofrecidas por la lógica tradicional, sino con engendrarlas y coordinarlas mediante el movimiento dialéctico del pensamiento mismo. Así como la Fenomenología ha mostrado que cada forma de la conciencia, al realizarse, se niega para resurgir más rica en la negación, del mismo modo la Lógica debe mostrar el mismo movimiento dialéctico en el sistema, de las categorías del pensamiento puro, cuya cadena, no se desarrolla por deducción analítica, que extrae de los eslabones antecedentes los sucesivos, sino en un proceso sintético creador, engendrado por lo insatisfactorio inherente a cada eslabón. La filosofía no hace otra cosa que seguir al pensamiento en esta dialéctica. Hay que diferenciar, por lo tanto, radicalmente esta lógica de la lógica formal, tradicional; y en esta diferencia estriba justamente la gran importancia Filosófica de este libro en el sistema de Hegel, y el interés fundamental que presenta su estudio, aun cuando implique la exigencia de afrontar y superar graves dificultades de lectura e interpretación.","author":[{"family":"Hegel","given":"Georg Wilhelm Friedrich"}],"citation-key":"hegelCienciaLogicaVol2017","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",1,2]]},"language":"es","note":"Item ID: _:n2","publisher":"ePubLibre","title":"Ciencia de la Lógica Vol. 1","type":"book"},

Al XIX pertenece la obra especulativa que le ha hecho famoso; al XVIII corresponden estos fascinantes escritos y apuntes de juventud, inéditos hasta hace pocos años. En ellos se resume y culmina toda la tradición emancipadora, sobre todo en cuanto que apuntaba ya al psicoanálisis, la crítica de la economía política, de la religión y de las instituciones. El proyecto de una humanidad feliz y libre se halla desplegado en ellos con toda la fuerza revolucionaria que sacudía a la juventud burguesa de su época. Estos escritos tempranos obligan, además, a replantear la interpretación acuñada sobre el Idealismo absoluto del Hegel especulativo, pues conservan y muestran toda la inquietud histórica que después acabó refugiándose en las formulaciones especulativas. Pero también confrontan a la burguesía ante el espejo de su juventud ilusionada y generosa, acercándola a una anagnórisis, a un reconocimiento de su historia verdadera, de sus intenciones ocultas.

Lo vital, lo permanente de la filosofía hegeliana es, a mi modo de ver, colocar en el centro del pensamiento el fenómeno mismo del cambio, del desarrollo, de la transformación, que hace del proceso del desarrollo la sustancia del filosofar. De dónde venga el impulso para los cambios es otro problema, ciertamente medular. Pero, desde Hegel, la concepción dialéctica de la filosofía es como una roca inconmovible.

To preserve humanity's future, he sacrificed his own by merging with a sandworm, granting him near immortality as God Emperor of Dune for the past thirty-five hundred years. Leto's rule is not a benevolent one. His transformation has made not only his appearance but his morality inhuman.

Ayudado por Panille el poeta, por Hali la tecmed, a la que Nave ha hecho vivir un acontecimiento muy antiguo ocurrido en el monte Gólgota, y por Waela, que sabe que en el océano de Pandora vive un ser inmenso y benévolo, el varec, Flattery cree poder conseguirlo.

Las escenas que transcurren en la nave proporcionan a la novela el ángulo mesiánico tan querido por Herbert; los intentos de colonización (militarista) proporcionan la acción y la intriga también tan queridas por Herbert; el varec le proporciona la ración de ensayo de ecologismo planetario que tanto éxito le dio en Dune.","author":[{"family":"Herbert","given":"Frank"}],"citation-key":"herbertIncidenteJesus1979","ISBN":"84-7386-812-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["1979"]]},"language":"es","note":"Item ID: _:n6","publisher":"ULTRAMAR EDITORES","title":"El incidente Jesús","type":"book"},

  {"id":"Holland1989","abstract":"TIle goal of the research described in tllls thesis is to find ways of using artificial intelligence to encourage and facilitate music composition by musical novices, particularly those without traditional musical skills. Two complementary approaches are presented. We show how tv.'o recent cognitive theories of hannony can be used to design a new kind of direct manipulation tool for music, known as \"Hannony Space\", with the expressivity 10 allow novices to sketch, analyse, modify and compose hannonic sequences simply and clearly by moving two-dimensional patterns on a computer screen linker to a synthesizer . Hannony Space provides novices with a way of describing and controlling hannonic structures and relationships using a single , principled, unifonn spatial metaphor at various musicalleve1s; note level , interval level, chord level, hanllonic succession level and key level. A prototype interface has been implemented to demonstrate the coherence and feasibility of the design. An investigation with a small number of subjects demonstrates that Hanllony Space considerably reduces the prerequisites required for novices to learn about, sketch, analyse and experiment with hannony - activities that would nomlally be very difficult for them without considerable theoretical knowledge or instmmental skill . TIle second part of the thesis presents work towards a knowledge-based tutoring system to help novices using the interface to compose chord sequences. It is argued that traditional, remedial intelligent tutoring systems approaches are inadequate for nltoring in domains that require open-ended thinking. TIle foundation of a new approach is developed based on the exploration and transfonnation of case snl¡lies described in tenns of chunks , styles and plans. 1llls approach draws on a characterisation of creativity due to Johnson-Laird (1988).

  {"id":"hollerwegerRevolutionHear2011","abstract":"This thesis presents a body of practical and theoretical work, which interprets sound art as a means of encouraging aural awareness in an everyday context. Through a methodological feedback loop of artistic practice and theoretical reﬂection, strategies for the aestheticisation of everyday aural experience have been developed and situated within a wider context of contemporary aural culture. The current state of this culture is critically examined. The widespread claim that we live in a deeply visualised culture is questioned. It is argued that contemporary Western society can also be characterised in terms of an increasing interest in auditory perception, which the development of sound art as an artistic discipline is one symptom of. The technological mediation of listening is discussed and characterised in terms of a mobilisation and individuation of aural experience. An overview of diﬀerent listening modes informs a discussion of six diﬀerent perspectives on sound as a physical and perceptual phenomenon. Various listening practices, which have been proposed in the ﬁeld of sound art, are presented. It is argued that the development of sound art as an artistic discipline can be characterised in terms of an interest in the everyday as a source of sound material on one, and as an environment for aestheticised listening on the other hand. Sound art is proposed as a means of auralising the rhythms inherent to everyday life, and subtlety is identiﬁed as an aesthetic category for doing so. It is investigated how technological mediation can be applied to the aestheticisation of mobile and social listening experiences. The above issues have been addressed by means of artistic practice. The results of this process are presented as a portfolio of eight artworks, including sound installations, public interventions, site-speciﬁc electroacoustic pieces, graphical scores and mobile hardware projects.","author":[{"family":"Hollerweger","given":"Florian"}],"citation-key":"hollerwegerRevolutionHear2011","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Queens University Belfast","source":"Zotero","title":"The Revolution is Hear!","type":"thesis"},

  {"id":"holmesReworkingBenchResearch2003","abstract":"Research records composed of notes and protocols have long played a role in the efforts to understand the origins of what have come to be seen as the established milestones in the development of modern science. The use of research records to probe the nature of scientific investigation itself however is a recent development in the history of science. With Eduard Dijksterhuis, we could address them as a veritable \"epistemologiCal laboratory\". The purpose of a workshop entitled \"Reworking the Bench: Laboratory Notebooks in the History of Science\", held at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin was to bring together historians who have been exploiting such resources, to compare the similarities and differences in the materials they had used and and to measure the potential and scope for future explorations of \"science in the making\" based on such forms of documentation. The contributions which form this volume are based on papers presented at this workshop or written afterward by participants in the discussions. This is the first book that addresses the issue of research notes for writing history of science in a comprehensive manner. Its case studies range from the early modern period to present and cover a broad range of different disciplines","author":[{"family":"Holmes","given":"Frederic Lawrence"},{"family":"Renn","given":"Jürgen"},{"family":"Rheinberger","given":"Hans-Jörg"}],"citation-key":"holmesReworkingBenchResearch2003","event-place":"Dordrecht","ISBN":"978-0-306-48152-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003"]]},"language":"en","note":"OCLC: 54061732","publisher":"Kluwer Academic Publishers","publisher-place":"Dordrecht","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Reworking the bench: research notebooks in the history of science","title-short":"Reworking the bench","type":"book"},

  {"id":"Holzer2019","abstract":"Vector Synthesis is a computational art project inspired by theories of media archaeology, by the history of computer and video art, and by the use of discarded and obsolete technologies such as the Cathode Ray Tube monitor. This text explores the military and techno-scientific legacies at the birth of modern computing, and charts attempts by artists of the subsequent two decades to decouple these tools from their destructive origins. Using this history as a basis, the author then describes a media archaeological, real time performance system using audio synthesis and vector graphics display techniques to investigate direct, synesthetic relationships between sound and image. Key to this system, realized in the Pure Data programming environment, is a didactic, open source approach which encourages reuse and modification by other artists within the experimental audiovisual arts community.","author":[{"family":"Holzer","given":"Ian Derek"}],"citation-key":"Holzer2019","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"page":"97 + 24","title":"Vector synthesis: a media archaeological investigation into sound-modulated light","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/handle/123456789/38066"},
  {"id":"hongoCALANGOPhylogenyawareComparative2023","abstract":"Living species vary signiﬁcantly in phenotype and genomic content. Sophisticated statistical methods linking genes with phenotypes within a species have led to breakthroughs in complex genetic diseases and genetic breeding. Despite the abundance of genomic and phenotypic data available for thousands of species, ﬁnding genotype-phenotype associations across species is challenging due to the non-independence of species data resulting from common ancestry. To address this, we present CALANGO (comparative analysis with annotation-based genomic components), a phylogeny-aware comparative genomics tool to ﬁnd homologous regions and biological roles associated with quantitative phenotypes across species. In two case studies, CALANGO identiﬁed both known and previously unidentiﬁed genotype-phenotype associations. The ﬁrst study revealed unknown aspects of the ecological interaction between Escherichia coli, its integrated bacteriophages, and the pathogenicity phenotype. The second identiﬁed an association between maximum height in angiosperms and the expansion of a reproductive mechanism that prevents inbreeding and increases genetic diversity, with implications for conservation biology and agriculture.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Hongo","given":"Jorge Augusto"},{"family":"De Castro","given":"Giovanni Marques"},{"family":"Albuquerque Menezes","given":"Alison Pelri"},{"family":"Rios Picorelli","given":"Agnello César"},{"family":"Martins Da Silva","given":"Thieres Tayroni"},{"family":"Imada","given":"Eddie Luidy"},{"family":"Marchionni","given":"Luigi"},{"family":"Del-Bem","given":"Luiz-Eduardo"},{"family":"Vieira Chaves","given":"Anderson"},{"family":"Almeida","given":"Gabriel Magno De Freitas"},{"family":"Campelo","given":"Felipe"},{"family":"Lobo","given":"Francisco Pereira"}],"citation-key":"hongoCALANGOPhylogenyawareComparative2023","container-title":"Patterns","container-title-short":"Patterns","DOI":"10.1016/j.patter.2023.100728","ISSN":"26663899","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",6]]},"language":"en","page":"100728","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"CALANGO: A phylogeny-aware comparative genomics tool for discovering quantitative genotype-phenotype associations across species","title-short":"CALANGO","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2666389923000685","volume":"4"},

  {"id":"HuiYuk2016","abstract":"A systematic historical survey of Chinese thought is followed by an investigation of the historical-metaphysical questions of modern technology, asking how Chinese thought might contribute to a renewed questioning of globalized technics. Heidegger's critique of modern technology and its relation to metaphysics has been widely accepted in the East. Yet the conception that there is only one—originally Greek—type of technics has been an obstacle to any original critical thinking of technology in modern Chinese thought.Yuk Hui argues for the urgency of imagining a specifically Chinese philosophy of technology capable of responding to Heidegger's challenge, while problematizing the affirmation of technics and technologies as anthropologically universal.This investigation of the historical-metaphysical question of technology, drawing on Lyotard, Simondon, and Stiegler, and introducing a history of modern Eastern philosophical thinking largely unknown to Western readers, including philosophers such as Feng Youlan, Mou Zongsan, and Keiji Nishitani, sheds new light on the obscurity of the question of technology in China. Why was technics never thematized in Chinese thought? Why has time never been a real question for Chinese philosophy? How was the traditional concept of Qi transformed in its relation to Dao as China welcomed technological modernity and westernization?In The Question Concerning Technology in China, a systematic historical survey of the major concepts of traditional Chinese thinking is followed by a startlingly original investigation of these questions, in order to ask how Chinese thought might today contribute to a renewed, cosmotechnical questioning of globalized technics.","author":[{"family":"Hui","given":"Yuk"}],"citation-key":"HuiYuk2016","container-title":"Urbanomic","ISBN":"0061319694","ISSN":"1098-6596","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"PMID":"28285","title":"The question concerning technology in China","type":"article-journal"},

Following the recent work using Flickr [16, 23], we empirically study material recognition of real-world objects using a rich set of local features.

Large-Margin Nearest Neighbor learning is used for a 30-fold dimension reduction. We improve the state-of-the-art accuracy on the Flickr dataset [16] from 45% to 54%.

But how much licence did Cage allow? Martin Iddon's book is the first volume to collect the complete extant correspondence between the composer and pianist David Tudor, one of Cage's most provocative and significant musical collaborators. The book presents their partnership from working together in New York in the early 1950s, through periods on tour in Europe, until the late stages of their work from the 1960s onwards, carried out almost exclusively within the frame of the Merce Cunningham Dance Company. Tackling the question of how much creative flexibility Tudor was granted, Iddon includes detailed examples of the ways in which Tudor realised Cage's work, especially focusing on Music of Changes to Variations II, to show how composer and pianist influenced one another's methods and styles.","author":[{"family":"Iddon","given":"Martin"}],"citation-key":"Iddon2009","container-title":"John cage and david tudor: Correspondence on interpretation and performance","DOI":"10.1017/CBO9781139013727","ISBN":"978-1-139-01372-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"page":"1–225","title":"John cage and david tudor: Correspondence on interpretation and performance","type":"chapter"},

  {"id":"Impett2018","abstract":"Of the post-war, post-serialist generation of European composers, it was Luigi Nono who succeeded not only in identifying and addressing aesthetic and technical questions of his time, but in showing a way ahead to a new condition of music in the twenty-first century. His music has found a listenership beyond the ageing constituency of ‘contemporary music'. In Nono's work, the audiences of sound art, improvisation, electronic, experimental and radical musics of many kinds find common cause with those concerned with the renewal of Western art music. His work explores the individually and socially transformative role of music; its relationship with history and with language; the nature of the musical work as distributed through text, time, technology and individuals; the nature and performativity of the act of composition; and, above all, the role and nature of listening as a cultural activity. In many respects his music anticipates the new technological state of culture of the twenty-first century while radically reconnecting with our past. His work is itself a case study in the evolution of musical activity and the musical object: from the period of an apparently stable place for art music in Western culture to its manifold new states in our century. Routledge Handbook to Luigi Nono and Musical Thought seeks to trace the evolution of Nono's musical thought through detailed examination of the vast body of sketches, and to situate this narrative in its personal, cultural and political contexts.","author":[{"family":"Impett","given":"Jonathan"}],"citation-key":"Impett2018","container-title":"Routledge handbook to luigi nono and musical thought","DOI":"10.4324/9780429485732","ISBN":"978-0-429-94086-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"1–528","title":"Routledge handbook to luigi nono and musical thought","type":"chapter"},

  {"id":"impettSoundWorkComposition2021","abstract":"The practices and perception of music creation have evolved with the cultural, social and technological contexts of music and musicians. But musical authorship, in its many technical and aesthetic modes, remains an important component of music culture. Musicians are increasingly called on to share their experience in writing. However, cultural imperatives to account for composition as knowledge production and to make claims for its uniqueness inhibit the development of discourse in both expert and public spheres. Internet pioneer Philip Agre observed a discourse deficit in artificial intelligence research and proposed a critical technical practice, a single disciplinary field with ?one foot planted in the craft work of design and the other foot planted in the reflexive work of critique. ? A critical technical practice rethinks its own premises, re-evaluates its own methods, and reconsiders its own concepts as a routine part of its daily work.?0This volume considers the potential for critical technical practice in the evolving situation of composition across a wide range of current practices.

En la era de la racionalidad triunfante, de la ciencia institucionalizada, de los avances tecnológicos y los sistemas inteligentes aparece una constelación extraña: al mismo tiempo que la ciencia goza de un enorme reconocimiento, muchas personas recelan de ella, desde la mera desconfianza hasta el negacionismo extremo. Este rechazo no se explica sin más por la resistencia irracional hacia el conocimiento propia de las sociedades tradicionales; nos está diciendo algo acerca del tipo de generación de conocimiento característico de nuestras sociedades. No entenderemos la sociedad en la que vivimos si no damos una explicación adecuada de este extraño antagonismo. No está en juego la racionalidad y su contrario, sino una cierta metamorfosis de la idea misma de racionalidad, que ya no puede definirse cómodamente frente a su simple negación. Perderíamos una gran ocasión de conocernos a nosotros mismos si descalificáramos esta incredulidad como una reacción al progreso civilizatorio. Hemos entendido la ignorancia como si fuera lo contrario de la racionalidad, pero apenas hemos reflexionado sobre la unidad de conocimiento y desconocimiento que nos caracteriza. Como siempre, el avance del conocimiento nos hace, a la vez, más sabios y más ignorantes.

  {"id":"jackEffectLatencyPerformer2016","abstract":"When designing digital musical instruments the importance of low and consistent action-to-sound latency is widely accepted. This paper investigates the eﬀects of latency (020ms) on instrument quality evaluation and performer interaction. We present ﬁndings from an experiment conducted with musicians who performed on an percussive digital musical instrument with variable amounts of latency. Three latency conditions were tested against a zero latency condition, 10ms, 20ms and 10ms ± 3ms jitter. The zero latency condition was signiﬁcantly rated more positively than the 10ms with jitter and 20ms latency conditions in six quality measures, emphasising the importance of not only low, but stable latency in digital musical instruments. There was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in rating between the zero latency condition and 10ms condition. A quantitative analysis of timing accuracy in a metronome task under latency conditions showed no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in mean synchronisation error. This suggests that the 20ms and 10ms with jitter latency conditions degrade subjective impressions of an instrument, but without signiﬁcantly aﬀecting the timing performance of our participants. These ﬁndings are discussed in terms of control intimacy and instrument transparency.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Jack","given":"Robert H."},{"family":"Stockman","given":"Tony"},{"family":"McPherson","given":"Andrew"}],"citation-key":"jackEffectLatencyPerformer2016","container-title":"Proceedings of the Audio Mostly 2016","DOI":"10.1145/2986416.2986428","event-place":"Norrköping Sweden","event-title":"AM '16: Audio Mostly 2016","ISBN":"978-1-4503-4822-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",10,4]]},"language":"en","page":"116-123","publisher":"ACM","publisher-place":"Norrköping Sweden","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Effect of latency on performer interaction and subjective quality assessment of a digital musical instrument","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2986416.2986428"},
  {"id":"jackRichGestureReduced2017","abstract":"This paper presents an observational study of the interaction of professional percussionists with a simpliﬁed hand percussion instrument. We reﬂect on how the sound-producing gestural language of the percussionists developed over the course of an hour session, focusing on the elements of their gestural vocabulary that remained in place at the end of the session, and on those that ceased to be used. From these observations we propose a model of movementbased digital musical instruments as a projection downwards from a multidimensional body language to a reduced set of sonic features or behaviours. Many factors of an instrument’s design, above and beyond the mapping of sensor degrees of freedom to dimensions of control, condition the way this projection downwards happens. We argue that there exists a world of richness of gesture beyond that which the sensors capture, but which can be implicitly captured by the design of the instrument through its physicality, constituent materials and form. We provide a case study of this model in action.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Jack","given":"Robert H."},{"family":"Stockman","given":"Tony"},{"family":"McPherson","given":"Andrew"}],"citation-key":"jackRichGestureReduced2017","container-title":"Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Movement Computing","DOI":"10.1145/3077981.3078039","event-place":"London United Kingdom","event-title":"MOCO '17: 4th International Conference on Movement Computing","ISBN":"978-1-4503-5209-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",6,28]]},"language":"en","page":"1-8","publisher":"ACM","publisher-place":"London United Kingdom","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Rich gesture, reduced control: the influence of constrained mappings on performance technique","title-short":"Rich gesture, reduced control","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3077981.3078039"},

These days, soundtracks are in high demand in industries such as TV, film, advertising, and even gaming to help create immersive and exciting experiences. Whatever your musical ambitions--composing a dark requiem in a beautiful Viennese apartment or producing the next great Star Wars-like movie theme in LA--the fully updated Music Composition For Dummies hits all the right notes to help you become confident in the theory and practice of composition. To help you translate your musical ideas from fleeting tunes in your head to playable bars and notation on paper, professional composer and instructor Scott Jarrett and music journalist Holly Day take you on a friendly step-by-step journey through the process of musical creation, including choosing the right rhythms and tempos, creating melodies and chord progressions, and working with instruments and voices.

  {"id":"jeremymontaguHowMusicInstruments2017","abstract":"Music must first be defined and distinguished from speech, and from animal and bird cries. We discuss the stages of hominid anatomy that permit music to be perceived and created, with the likelihood of both H. neanderthalensis and H. sapiens both being capable. The earlier hominid ability to emit sounds of variable pitch with some meaning, shows that music at its simplest level must have predated speech. The possibilities of anthropoid motor impulse suggest that rhythm may have preceded melody, though full control of rhythm may well not have come any earlier than the perception of music above. There are four evident purposes for music: dance, ritual, entertainment personal and communal, and above all social cohesion, again on both personal and communal levels. We then proceed to how instruments began, with a brief survey of the surviving examples from the Mousterian period onwards, including the possible Neanderthal evidence and the extent to which they showed ‘artistic’ potential in other fields. We warn that our performance on replicas of surviving instruments may bear little or no resemblance to that of the original players. We continue with how later instruments, strings and skin-drums began and developed into instruments we know in worldwide cultures today. The sound of music is then discussed, scales and intervals, and the lack of any consistency of consonant tonality around the world. This is followed by iconographic evidence of the instruments of later antiquity into the European Middle Ages, and finally the history of public performance, again from the possibilities of early humanity into more modern times. This paper draws the ethnomusicological perspective on the entire development of music, instruments, and performance, from the times of H. neanderthalensis and H. sapiens into those of modern musical history, and it is written with the deliberate intention of informing readers who are without special education in music, and providing necessary information for inquiries into the origin of music by cognitive scientists.","author":[{"literal":"Jeremy Montagu"},{"family":"Montagu","given":"Jeremy"},{"family":"Montagu","given":"Jeremy"}],"citation-key":"jeremymontaguHowMusicInstruments2017","container-title":"Frontiers in Sociology","DOI":"10.3389/fsoc.2017.00008","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",6,20]]},"note":"MAG ID: 2689731742\nS2ID: 72b877d769d04ea8e8e554c98d9b9630e4198c76","title":"How Music and Instruments Began: A Brief Overview of the Origin and Entire Development of Music, from Its Earliest Stages","type":"article-journal","volume":"2"},
  {"id":"jessopGesturalMediaFramework2008","abstract":"As human movement is an incredibly rich mode of communication and expression, performance artists working with digital media often use performers' movement and gestures to control and shape that digital media as part of a theatrical, choreographic, or musical performance. In my own work, I have found that strong, semantically-meaningful mappings between gesture and sound or visuals are necessary to create compelling performance interactions. However, the existing systems for developing mappings between incoming data streams and output media have extremely low-level concepts of “gesture.” The actual programming process focuses on low-level sensor data, such as the voltage values of a particular sensor, which limits the user in his or her thinking process, requires users to have significant programming experience, and loses the expressive, meaningful, and metaphor-rich content of the movement. To remedy these difficulties, I have created a new framework and development environment for gestural control of media in rehearsal and performance, allowing users to create clear and intuitive mappings in a simple and flexible manner by using high-level descriptions of gestures and of gestural qualities. This approach, the Gestural Media Framework, recognizes continuous gesture and translates Laban Effort Notation into the realm of technological gesture analysis, allowing for the abstraction and encapsulation of sensor data into movement descriptions. As part of the evaluation of this system, I choreographed four performance pieces that use this system throughout the performance and rehearsal process to map dancers' movements to manipulation of sound and visual elements. This work has been supported by the MIT Media Laboratory.","author":[{"family":"Jessop","given":"Elena Naomi"}],"citation-key":"jessopGesturalMediaFramework2008","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"A Gestural Media Framework: Tools for Expressive Gesture Recognition and Mapping in Rehearsal and Performance","type":"thesis"},

  {"id":"jiangMultilabelAutomaticIndexing2013","abstract":"Recently, numerous successful approaches have been developed for instrument recognition in monophonic sounds. Unfortunately, none of them can be successfully applied to polyphonic sounds. Identiﬁcation of music instruments in polyphonic sounds is still difﬁcult and challenging. This has stimulated a number of research projects on music sound separation, new features development, and more recently on hierarchically structured classiﬁers used in content-based music recommender systems. This paper introduces a hierarchically structured cascade classiﬁcation system to estimate multiple timbre information from the polyphonic sound by classiﬁcation which is based on acoustic features and short-term power spectrum matching. This cascade system makes a ﬁrst estimate on the higher level decision attribute which stands for the musical instrument family. Then, the further estimation is done within that speciﬁc family range. Experiments showed better performance of a hierarchical system than the traditional ﬂat classiﬁcation method which directly estimates the instrument without higher level of family information analysis. Traditional hierarchical structures were constructed in human semantics, which are meaningful from human perspective but not appropriate for a cascade system. We introduce a new hierarchical instrument schema according to the clustering results of the acoustic features. This new schema better describes the similarity among different instruments or among different playing techniques of the same instrument.

Pero el intelectual no es un servidor o intérprete de los dioses; es un sustituto que afirma poder diagnosticar y curar los males de la sociedad sin más ayuda que su intelecto. Este libro provocador constituye un examen de las credenciales, de orden moral y de criterio, que poseen los intelectuales para aconsejar a la humanidad: su método para arribar a conclusiones, su respeto por la verdad, la aplicación de los principios públicos a sus vidas privadas, su actitud ante el dinero, su relación con la esposa y los hijos. Estos temas son abordados en una serie de estudios de casos, Rousseau, Shelley, Marx, Ibsen, Tolstoi, Hemingway, Russell, Brecht, Sartre, Lillian Hellman y otros, los cuales se revelan en retratos incisivos como intelectuales a la vez brillantes y contradictorios, magnéticos y peligrosos.","author":[{"family":"Johnson","given":"Paul"}],"citation-key":"johnsonIntelectuales1988","issued":{"date-parts":[["1988",1,1]]},"language":"es","note":"Item ID: _:n7","publisher":"ePubLibre","title":"Intelectuales","type":"book"},

Bajo máscaras infinitamente variadas, de la más ingenua a la más sofisticada, Laurent Jullier descubre seis criterios para el juicio del gusto en materia cinematográfica; el éxito, la técnica, La edificación, la emoción, La originalidad y la coherencia. A partir de numerosos ejemplos extraídos de la actividad crítica o las conversaciones cotidianas, el autor investiga la utilización, el sentido y tas condiciones de validez de esos criterios. También pone en entredicho muchos de nuestros tópicos, ideas recibidas e incluso rituales inconscientes. Después de leer este libro, seguramente ya no diremos las mismas cosas ni entablaremos las mismas conversaciones al salir de una sala de cine. Y, sin embargo, el texto no sólo concierne al mundo del cine, sino que constituye, más ampliamente, una especie de introducción al uso razonado del juicio y del gusto.

Estos son ejemplos de ruido: el sesgo que conlleva variabilidad en juicios que deberían ser iguales. El ruido está presente en todas las decisiones individuales y colectivas, y produce errores en innumerables terrenos, desde la medicina hasta la economía, pasando por el derecho, la sanidad, la protección infantil y la contratación. Además, también nos importuna e influye a la hora de tomar muchas de nuestras decisiones cotidianas. Daniel Kahneman, uno de los psicólogos más importantes del mundo, junto con Cass R. Sunstein y Olivier Sibony, dos eminencias mundiales en pensamiento estratégico, nos enseñan a escuchar ese ruido, cuyo impacto tendemos a ignorar, y a reducirlo para mejorar nuestros juicios.

  {"id":"Kaminsky2011","abstract":"\"Unmasking Ravel: New Perspectives on the Music\" fills a unique place in Ravel studies by combining critical interpretation and analytical focus. From the premiere of his works up to the present, Ravel has been associated with masks and the related notions of artifice and imposture. This has led scholars to perceive a lack of depth in his music and, consequently, to discourage investigation of his musical language. This volume balances and interweaves these modes of inquiry. Part 1, \"Orientations and Influences,\" illuminates the sometimes contradictory aesthetic, biographical, and literary strands comprising Ravel's artistry and our understanding of it. Part 2, \"Analytical Case Studies,\" engages representative works from Ravel's major genres using a variety of methodologies, focusing on structural process and his complex relation to stylistic convention. Part 3, \"Interdisciplinary Studies,\" integrates musical analysis and art criticism, semiotics, and psychoanalysis in creating novel methodologies. Contributors include prominent scholars of Ravel's and fin-de-siècle music: Elliott Antokoletz, Gurminder Bhogal, Sigrun B. Heinzelmann, Volker Helbing, Steven Huebner, Peter Kaminsky, Barbara Kelly, David Korevaar, Daphne Leong, Michael Puri, and Lauri Suurpää.

  {"id":"Kane2008","abstract":"This paper employs a Wittgensteinian framework to describe the experience of listening to the music of Mathias Spahlinger. First, a 'skeptical puzzle' is introduced, based on a reading of Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations. The puzzle problematizes the security of ascriptions of meaning to material practices. Then, Spahlinger's ephemere is used as a test case: it is described from a first-person perspective, compared with an account of the work given by Claus-Steffen Mahnkopf, and given as an example of an audible presentation of the 'skeptical puzzle'. Such a presentation is marked by a phenomenon that Wittgenstein described as 'the dawning of an aspect'. By focusing on the role of aspect perception and the problems of ascription in Spahlinger's music, it is possible to argue against Mahnkopf's criticism of Spahlinger's work, as well as understand an underlying affinity between extreme forms of repetition and perpetual transition within Spahlinger's compositional habitus.","author":[{"family":"Kane","given":"Brian"}],"citation-key":"Kane2008","container-title":"Contemporary Music Review","DOI":"10.1080/07494460802410328","ISBN":"0749446080","ISSN":"07494467","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"page":"595–609","title":"Aspect and ascription in the music of Mathias Spahlinger","type":"article-journal","volume":"27"},
  {"id":"kanervistoActionSpaceShaping2020","abstract":"Reinforcement learning (RL) has been successful in training agents in various learning environments, including video games. However, such work modiﬁes and shrinks the action space from the game’s original. This is to avoid trying “pointless” actions and to ease the implementation. Currently, this is mostly done based on intuition, with little systematic research supporting the design decisions. In this work, we aim to gain insight on these action space modiﬁcations by conducting extensive experiments in video game environments. Our results show how domain-speciﬁc removal of actions and discretization of continuous actions can be crucial for successful learning. With these insights, we hope to ease the use of RL in new environments, by clarifying what action-spaces are easy to learn.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Kanervisto","given":"Anssi"},{"family":"Scheller","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Hautamäki","given":"Ville"}],"citation-key":"kanervistoActionSpaceShaping2020","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2004.00980","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",5,26]]},"language":"en","number":"arXiv:2004.00980","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Action Space Shaping in Deep Reinforcement Learning","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00980"},

It is unclear which of these activities are responsible for an increase in cerebral blood flow. We investigated the factors increasing middle cerebral artery velocity (MCAv) during musical performance, and examined whether playing and reading music affects cognitive function. Seventeen musicians played an instrument with reading music, played music from memory, and read music scores in a randomized order, for 10 min each. The MCAv was continuously recorded from 5 min before to 10 min after the performance. A Stroop test was performed before and after performance. The MCAv increased significantly with reading music, playing from memory, and reading music. Stroop test scores increased significantly after music reading. These findings suggest that both music reading and playing an instrument are involved in the increase in MCAv during music performance. Cognitive function was transiently improved by playing musical instruments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Kawasaki","given":"Ai"},{"family":"Hayashi","given":"Naoyuki"}],"citation-key":"kawasakiMusicalInstrumentalReading2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Physiology","container-title-short":"Front.

  {"id":"Kelly2014","abstract":"This paper points out an ambiguity in Cass Sunstein's recent work concerning whose lives and interests are to be promoted by libertarian paternalism, and argues that this ambiguity stems from a lack of clarity regarding how we should understand the relevance of the heuristics and biases literature for democratic theory. The paper attempts to extract from Sunstein's work an account of how we should go about identifying biases in social choices. It argues that Sunstein's view on this issue has changed over the years, and identifies a trend in his thinking moving away from libertarian paternalism and toward libertarian welfarism.","author":[{"family":"Kelly","given":"Jamie Terence"}],"citation-key":"Kelly2014","DOI":"10.1353/gso.2014.0016","ISSN":"15389731","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"page":"179–192","title":"The life you save may not be your own","type":"document","volume":"23"},

  {"id":"khavisseNuevoPoderEconomico1986","abstract":"A lo largo de la última década y, en particular, bajo el régimen militar que rigió el país entre 1976 y 1983, el capitalismo argentino experimentó una profunda reestructuración. Algunos de sus aspectos son relativamente bien conocidos: los mecanismos Financieros adquirieron un papel privilegiado en el proceso de acumulación, la industria dejó de ser el factor dinamizador de la actividad económica, las pequeñas y medianas empresas perdieron posiciones en beneficio de las grandes firmas oligopólicas, los asalariados se vieron sometidos a un acentuado deterioro de su nivel de ingresos. Menos claridad existe, en cambio, acerca de la estructura del nuevo poder económico que ha emergido de este proceso, y en tal sentido se orienta el presente estudio de los economistas Daniel Azpiazu y Eduardo M. Basualdo y el sociólogo Miguel Khavisse. El análisis, que se apoya en un cuidadoso estudio de casos, destaca ciertos cambios sumamente significativos que se han producido dentro de los propios sectores oligopólicos, en especial el avance de grupos ampliamente diversificados que controlan un gran número de empresas industriales y no industriales. Se trata, a juicio de los autores, de la instalación de un nuevo bloque social hegemónico, cuyos intereses definen hoy el rumbo de la economía argentina.","author":[{"family":"Khavisse","given":"Daniel Azpiazu & Eduardo M.

  {"id":"kieferLightweightArchitecturesEmbedded2022","abstract":"It can be challenging to engage with machine learning in restricted computing environments, such as the systems often in use in digital or hybrid musical instruments. We often use low power, low memory devices with limited computational power, and need high frequency models for sensor and sound processing. Conversely, contemporary machine learning and AI can be resource hungry, limiting its use in embedded systems. In previous research, the Stochastic Logic Optimisation algorithm offered a method of lightweight machine learning using two-state logic networks, intended for musical use in embedded systems. This experiment shows how this approach can be expanded on, using random boolean reservoirs, for signal generation. These initial results demonstrate the efficacy of a reservoir computing approach, built only from networks of lookup tables. They show that, for the task of training sine wave generators, reservoirs can be improved if built with hierarchical growth algorithms, and further improved by selecting inputs and outputs based on network centrality. The results also demonstrate successful use of Pulse Density Modulation for signal encoding.","author":[{"family":"Kiefer","given":"Chris"}],"citation-key":"kieferLightweightArchitecturesEmbedded2022","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Towards Lightweight Architectures for Embedded Machine Learning in Musical Instruments","type":"article-journal"},

Una clase magistral de Stephen King sobre el oficio de escribir. Una obra auténtica, lúcida y pragmática en la que se une la historia de su vida con el arte de la escritura. Pocas veces un libro sobre el oficio de escribir ha resultado tan clarificador, útil y revelador. Mientras escribo empieza con el relato de la asombrosa infancia de Stephen King y su extraño y temprano interés por la escritura. Una serie de vividos recuerdos de la adolescencia, de la universidad y de los años de lucha que lo llevaron a la culminación de su primera novela, Carne, aportan al lector una amena y a menudo divertida perspectiva sobre la formación del escritor. A continuación King describe las herramientas básicas del oficio y expone y ejemplifica sus muy personales opiniones sobre el secreto de la escritura. Mientras escribo culmina con el conmovedor relato de cómo su necesidad de escribir lo estimuló a conseguir recuperarse de su casi fatal accidente en el verano de 2000. Brillantemente estructurada, amena e inspiradora, esta obra resultará motivadora para todos sus lectores -fans del autor, críticos literarios, futuros escritores o estudiosos del arte de escribir-, que descubrirán además las vicisitudes del hombre que se esconde tras el famoso escritor.","author":[{"family":"King","given":"Stephen"}],"citation-key":"kingMientrasEscribo2000","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000",1,1]]},"language":"es","note":"Item ID: _:n0","publisher":"ePubLibre","title":"Mientras escribo","type":"book"},

  {"id":"kingwellSingularCreaturesRobots2022","abstract":"\"Anxiety about non-human intelligent machines is a longstanding theme of cultural production and consumption. These range from tales of golems and Frankenstein's monster to the evil overlord scenarios of contemporary film and television franchises: Star Trek, the Alien series, and the Terminator sequence, as well as Her, Black Mirror, Blade Runner, Ex Machina, and many, many other less mainstream cultural artifacts. The source of this anxiety is clear. Non-human conscious entities may turn out to be superior to any biological form of life, allowing a stride across human ambition in a moment dubbed \"the Singularity\" by AI insiders. This is the turning point when non-human entities advance and reproduce in a manner that surpasses and subjugates biological forms of intelligent life. Although today's artificial intelligences fall notably short of this level of sophistication, Mark Kingwell argues that we are already more than human in important ways, and likely to become more so as time goes on. In Singular Creatures Kingwell plumbs the depths of cultural and political meaning in the apparent transition to posthuman life. Our immersion in technology, now comprehensive to the point of invisibility, has altered forever what it means to be alive. The politics of posthumanism flow directly from our own situation, at once dependent on technology and afraid of its effects on current and future experiences. More than a century after playwright Karel Čapek coined the word robot--rooted in the Czech robota, meaning \"servitude\" or \"drudgery\"--in his 1920 allegory about the alienation of forced labour leading to a violent workers' revolt, Čapek's central question continues to haunt us still. Can humans and their own creations co-exist in a new cyberflesh world, or is a struggle for superiority inevitable? Singular Creatures is an attempt at sketching the field before any deadly battle is joined.\"-- Provided by publisher","author":[{"family":"Kingwell","given":"Mark"}],"citation-key":"kingwellSingularCreaturesRobots2022","event-place":"Montreal","ISBN":"978-0-2280-1538-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"en","note":"OCLC: 1313808517","publisher":"McGill-Queen's University Press","publisher-place":"Montreal","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Singular creatures: robots, rights, and the politics of posthumanism","title-short":"Singular creatures","type":"book"},

  {"id":"Klee1945","abstract":"Paul Klee occupies a unique position among the creators of modern art. Although he shed all ties with conventional presentation, he developed a closer and deeper relationship to reality than did most painters of his time. Without any attempt at imitation or idealization, he recorded proportion, motion, and depth in space as the fundamental attributes of the visual world. Klee collected his observations in his PEDAGOGICAL SKETCH BOOK, intended as the basis for the course in design theory at the famous Bauhaus art school in Germany. From the simple phenomenon of interweaving lines, his work leads to the comprehension of defined planes-of structure, dimen sion, equilibrium, and motion. But he employs no abstract formulas. The student remains in the familiar world-a world that acquires new significance through the straight forward approach of Klee's simple, lucid drawings and his precise captions.

With his personal, expressive, and versatile music, he became the most prominent representative of his generation. His individual approach to music was established in the 1980s and he continues to explore and enlarge his original concepts today. His 1980s work is at the core of this book, more specifically his instrumental music: the ¡i¿Chiffre¡/i¿ cycle and the string quartets. Thinking about Rihm includes reflecting on his interest in philosophy, his relation to fine arts, his awareness of principles found in nature, and his references to important composers from the past. His music is embedded in the past and the actuality in modernism and postmodernism. Notwithstanding Rihm's generosity in essays and introductions to his works, many aspects of the 'inner sound' of his music stay an elusive, ungraspable 'chiffre': a challenge for the analyst.

  {"id":"knytFerruccioBusoniArchitect2023","abstract":"Abstract\n            This book presents a broad view of Busoni’s compositional activities as not only connected to musical traditions of the past, especially the music of J. S. Bach and W. A. Mozart, but also as closely aligned with contemporary interest in experimentalism. Developments during the twentieth century included new means of pitch organization, the spatialization of sound, and the expansion of formal structures. Busoni helped pioneer these trends by writing pieces in which sound radiates from different directions, by creating montage formal structures, and by freely using all twelve pitches of the chromatic scale without avoiding consonances. In the process, the book brings Busoni’s music into discourse with recent multivalent accounts of modernism in music that move beyond notions of rupture with the past as well as beyond elitist esotericism. In addition, it reveals that many of Busoni’s innovations were rooted in interdisciplinary thinking that reconciled the spatial and the temporal in unique manners. While his abstract metaphysical notions of music transcended physical boundaries, the realization of his ideas was informed by an understanding of tangible architectural spaces and styles fostered by the study of buildings and floor plans. In addition, he engaged in a rich exchange of ideas with contemporary architects and artists, such as Henry Van de Velde and members of the Weimar Bauhaus. The book concludes by documenting ways Busoni’s spatialized architectural music left a lasting imprint on future generations of composers, artists, and early film pioneers, such as Hans Richter, Heinrich Neugeboren, Wladimir Vogel, Stefan Wolpe, and Edgard Varèse.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Knyt","given":"Erinn E."}],"citation-key":"knytFerruccioBusoniArchitect2023","DOI":"10.1093/oso/9780197625491.001.0001","edition":"1","ISBN":"978-0-19-762549-1 978-0-19-762552-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,10]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Oxford University PressNew York","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Ferruccio Busoni as Architect of Sound","type":"book","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/book/45614"},

Renown avant-garde composer Edgard Varèse (1883-1965), in his text The Liberation of Sound popularized the notion that music is organized Sound;1 and Andrea Moro a distinguished linguist and neuroscientist, in his book Impossible Languages, suggested that language can also be present in the absence of Sound, like “when we read or when we use words while thinking.”2 That assumes that we have already learned a language before we can “internalize” the sounds. Similarly, composers and conductors are trained to “hear” the orchestra’s sound inside their heads with great accuracy. This training is to prepare for the moment the premiere is performed live on stage in front of the audience. Hearing the sounds in our heads from the manuscript doesn’t seem to give the same kind of listening experience. Seating in the concert hall watching the orchestra perform may not be music either.

In this approach, the setting of the electronic device is prepared in such a way to be able to organise its own function, according to the conditions of the sonic environment. We discuss the approaches of Xenakis and of Di Scipio in relation to Systemics, demonstrating the applications in their compositional models. In my critique on Di Scipio's approach, I argue that the composer is giving away a major part of his control over the work and therefore the notion of macro-structural form is abandoned. Based on my work Ephemeron, I show that it is possible to conduct emerging situations applying the systemic principle of 'equifinality'. Moreover, I argue that it is possible to acquire control over these situations and their properties over time so as to develop formal structure.","author":[{"family":"Kollias","given":"Phivos Angelos"}],"citation-key":"kolliasEphemeronControlSelforganised2008","container-title":"Proceedings of the 5th Sound and Music Computing Conference, SMC 2008","ISBN":"9783798320949","issue":"December","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"page":"138–146","title":"Ephemeron: Control over self-organised music","type":"article-journal","volume":"14"},
  {"id":"kolozaliAutomaticOntologyGeneration2013a","abstract":"In this paper we present a novel hybrid system that involves a formal method of automatic ontology generation for web-based audio signal processing applications. An ontology is seen as a knowledge management structure that represents domain knowledge in a machine interpretable format. It describes concepts and relationships within a particular domain, in our case, the domain of musical instruments. However, the different tasks of ontology engineering including manual annotation, hierarchical structuring and organization of data can be laborious and challenging. For these reasons, we investigate how the process of creating ontologies can be made less dependent on human supervision by exploring concept analysis techniques in a Semantic Web environment. In this study, various musical instruments, from wind to string families, are classiﬁed using timbre features extracted from audio. To obtain models of the analysed instrument recordings, we use K-means clustering to determine an optimised codebook of Line Spectral Frequencies (LSFs), or Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefﬁcients (MFCCs). Two classiﬁcation techniques based on Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network and Support Vector Machines (SVM) were tested. Then, Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is used to automatically build the hierarchical structure of musical instrument ontologies. Finally, the generated ontologies are expressed using the Ontology Web Language (OWL). System performance was evaluated under natural recording conditions using databases of isolated notes and melodic phrases. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) were conducted with the feature and classiﬁer attributes as independent variables and the musical instrument recognition F-measure as dependent variable. Based on these statistical analyses, a detailed comparison between musical instrument recognition models is made to investigate their effects on the automatic ontology generation system. The proposed system is general and also applicable to other research ﬁelds that are related to ontologies and the Semantic Web.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Kolozali","given":"Sefki"},{"family":"Barthet","given":"Mathieu"},{"family":"Fazekas","given":"Gyorgy"},{"family":"Sandler","given":"Mark"}],"citation-key":"kolozaliAutomaticOntologyGeneration2013a","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","container-title-short":"IEEE Trans.

  {"id":"kramerHumWorldPhilosophy2018","abstract":"The Hum of the World is an invitation to contemplate what would happen if we heard the world as attentively as we see it. Balancing big ideas with playful wit and lyrical prose, this imaginative volume identifies the role of sound in Western experience as the primary medium in which the presence and persistence of life acquire tangible form. The positive experience of aliveness is not merely in accord with sound, but inaccessible, even inconceivable, without it. Lawrence Kramer's poetic book roves freely over music, media, language, philosophy, and science from the ancient world to the present, along the way revealing how life is apprehended through sounds ranging from pandemonium to the faint background hum of the world. Easily moving from reflections on pivotal texts and music to the introduction of elemental concepts, this warm meditation on auditory culture uncovers the knowledge and pleasure made available when we recognize that the world is alive with sound","author":[{"family":"Kramer","given":"Lawrence"}],"call-number":"152.15","citation-key":"kramerHumWorldPhilosophy2018","event-place":"Oakland, [California]","ISBN":"978-0-520-30349-2 978-0-520-97272-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"University of California press","publisher-place":"Oakland, [California]","source":"BnF ISBN","title":"The hum of the world: a philosophy of listening","title-short":"The hum of the world","type":"book"},

In this film, Rianto is not as a reference, but as a model to describe simulates feminine and masculine concepts in one body on film as a simulacrum; to produce an image that is completely unrelated to reality. The purpose of this study is to show the form of hyperreality in the film “Memories of My Body”. This study used a philosophical hermeneutic approach for interpreting how hyperreality forms in the film. This study found the simulations of feminine and masculine concepts in the film. So, the result of this research is a new horizon about the concept of hyperreality. The study can be concluded that hyperreality is not only found in a film that has science fiction or virtual reality, but also, in drama films with a local culture representing a form of hyperreality.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Kurniasih","given":"Puri"},{"family":"Sunarto","given":"Bambang"},{"family":"Christomy","given":"Tommy"}],"citation-key":"kurniasihNewHorizonHyperreality2020a","container-title":"Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Language, Literature, Culture, and Education (ICOLLITE 2020)","DOI":"10.2991/assehr.k.201215.088","event-place":"Bandung, Indonesia","event-title":"4th International Conference on Language, Literature, Culture, and Education (ICOLLITE 2020)","ISBN":"978-94-6239-303-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Atlantis Press","publisher-place":"Bandung, Indonesia","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A New Horizon of Hyperreality: Simulacrum on Film “Memories of My Body” by Garin Nugroho","title-short":"A New Horizon of Hyperreality","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://www.atlantis-press.com/article/125949374"},

  {"id":"kwapinskaTechnologicalEvolutionPolitical2022","abstract":"The question of political agency with respect to artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly relevant insofar as we can observe efforts to regulate it. Some policy proposals link the problem of the advance of AI to the concept of technological evolution. However, it is still not quite clear what they mean by this concept. This paper explores conceptualisations of technological agency and evolution in Bernard Stiegler’s general organology and Friedrich Schelling’s universal organicism. I argue that organicism proposes a more ‘naturalised’ approach to agency formation and a more ‘organic’ explanation of technology than general organology. General organology considers technological evolution from a human perspective, whereas universal organicism can accommodate a theory of technological evolution independently from its social dimensions. While technology already has a strong impact on the organisation of our societies, recognition of technological agency as at least partially independent serves to recognise them as non-human beings that impact politics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Kwapińska","given":"Kamila"}],"citation-key":"kwapinskaTechnologicalEvolutionPolitical2022","container-title":"Információs Társadalom","container-title-short":"InfTars","DOI":"10.22503/inftars.XXII.2022.2.4","ISSN":"2063-4552, 1587-8694","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,31]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0","page":"57","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Technological Evolution and the Political Agency of Artificial Intelligence from the Perspective of General Organology and Universal Organicism","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://inftars.infonia.hu/article.php?doi=inftars.XXII.2022.2.4","volume":"22"},

Conditions that may stimulate subconscious mental processes to generate useful ideas are discussed.

Gran parte del libro toma la forma de una conversación entre un profesor y sus estudiantes. Ellos proponen varias soluciones a problemas matemáticos e investigan las fortalezas y debilidades de tales soluciones. En sus discusiones (que discurren paralelas a ciertos desarrollos reales en la historia de las matemáticas) afloran algunos problemas filosóficos acerca de la naturaleza del descubrimiento matemático o de la creatividad. Imre Lakatos se esfuerza en desterrar la imagen clásica del desarrollo matemático como una constante acumulación de verdades establecidas. En su lugar, demuestra que la matemática crece a través del proceso, mucho más rico y dramático, de la mejora sucesiva de hipótesis creativas a través de los intentos de «probarlas» y las sucesivas críticas a dichos intentos: es la lógica de pruebas y refutaciones.","author":[{"family":"Lakatos","given":"Imre"}],"citation-key":"lakatosPruebasRefutaciones1976","issued":{"date-parts":[["1976",1,1]]},"language":"es","note":"Item ID: _:n1","publisher":"ePubLibre","title":"Pruebas y refutaciones","type":"book"},

  {"id":"landaRiseRealism2017","abstract":"Until quite recently, almost no philosophers trained in the continental tradition saw anything of value in realism. The situation in analytic philosophy was always different, but in continental philosophy realism was usually treated as a pseudo-problem. That is no longer the case. In this provocative new book, two leading philosophers examine the remarkable rise of realism in the continental tradition. While exploring the similarities and differences in their own positions, they also consider the work of others and assess rival trends in contemporary philosophy. They begin by discussing the relation between realism and materialism, which DeLanda links closely but which Harman tries to separate. Part Two covers the many different meanings of realism, with the two authors working together to develop an expanded definition of the term. Part Three features a spirited exchange on the respective virtues and drawbacks of DeLanda's realism of attractors and singularities and Harman's object-oriented theory. Part Four shifts to the question of the knowability of the real, as the authors discuss whether scientific knowledge does full justice to reality. In Part Five, they shift the focus to space, time, and science more generally, and here Harman offers a defence of actor-network theory despite its obvious anti-realist elements. Lively, accessible and engaging, this book is the best attempt so far to clarify the different paths for realism in continental philosophy","author":[{"family":"Landa","given":"Manuel","dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Harman","given":"Graham"}],"citation-key":"landaRiseRealism2017","event-place":"Cambridge Malden (Mass.)","ISBN":"978-1-5095-1902-6 978-1-5095-1903-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Polity","publisher-place":"Cambridge Malden (Mass.)","source":"BnF ISBN","title":"The rise of realism","type":"book"},

The following text explores the ways Saunders’ work has balanced these interests; it originated in an interview initiated by Simon Reynell to accompany the CD release of Saunders’ composition assigned #15, performed by Apartment House, on Reynell’s Another Timbre label.

The conventional perception of science in Western societies has been modified in recent years by the work of philosophers, sociologists and historians of science. In this book Bruno Latour brings together these different approaches to provide a lively and challenging analysis of science, demonstrating how social context and technical content are both essential to a proper understanding of scientific activity. Emphasizing that science can only be understood through its practice, the author examines science and technology in action: the role of scientific literature, the activities of laboratories, the institutional context of science in the modern world, and the means by which inventions and discoveries become accepted. From the study of scientific practice he develops an analysis of science as the building of networks. Throughout, Bruno Latour shows how a lively and realistic picture of science in action alters our conception of not only the natural sciences but also the social sciences and the sociology of knowledge in general. This stimulating book, drawing on a wealth of examples from a wide range of scientific activities, will interest all philosophers, sociologists and historians of science, scientists and engineers, and students of the philosophy of social science and the sociology of knowledge\".

  {"id":"leeGigaMIDIDatasetFeatures2025","abstract":"The Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI), introduced in 1983, revolutionized music production by allowing computers and instruments to communicate efﬁciently. MIDI ﬁles encode musical instructions compactly, facilitating convenient music sharing. They beneﬁt music information retrieval (MIR), aiding in research on music understanding, computational musicology, and generative music. The GigaMIDI dataset contains over 1.4 million unique MIDI ﬁles, encompassing 1.8 billion MIDI note events and over 5.3 million MIDI tracks. GigaMIDI is currently the largest collection of symbolic music in MIDI format available for research purposes under fair dealing. Distinguishing between non-expressive and expressive MIDI tracks is challenging, as MIDI ﬁles do not inherently make this distinction. To address this issue, we introduce a set of innovative heuristics for detecting expressive music performance. These include the distinctive note velocity ratio (DNVR) heuristic, which analyzes MIDI note velocity; the distinctive note onset deviation ratio (DNODR) heuristic, which examines deviations in note onset times; and the note onset median metric level (NOMML) heuristic, which evaluates onset positions relative to metric levels. Our evaluation demonstrates these heuristics effectively differentiate between non-expressive and expressive MIDI tracks. Furthermore, after evaluation, we create the most substantial expressive MIDI dataset, employing our heuristic NOMML. This curated iteration of GigaMIDI encompasses expressively performed instrument tracks detected by NOMML, containing all General MIDI instruments, constituting 31% of the GigaMIDI dataset, totaling 1,655,649 tracks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Lee","given":"Keon Ju Maverick"},{"family":"Ens","given":"Jeff"},{"family":"Adkins","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Sarmento","given":"Pedro"},{"family":"Barthet","given":"Mathieu"},{"family":"Pasquier","given":"Philippe"}],"citation-key":"leeGigaMIDIDatasetFeatures2025","container-title":"Transactions of the International Society for Music Information Retrieval","container-title-short":"TISMIR","DOI":"10.5334/tismir.203","ISSN":"2514-3298","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,7]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The GigaMIDI Dataset with Features for Expressive Music Performance Detection","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://account.transactions.ismir.net/index.php/up-j-tismir/article/view/203","volume":"8"},

This classification system was originally designed for musical instruments and books about instruments, and was first published in German in 1914. Hornbostel-Sachs has dominated organological discourse and practice since its creation, and this article analyses the scheme’s context, background, versions and impact. The position of Hornbostel-Sachs in the history and development of instrument classification is explored. This is followed by a detailed analysis of the mechanics of the scheme, including its decimal notation, the influential broad categories of the scheme, its warrant, and its typographical layout. The version history of the scheme is outlined and the relationships between versions is visualised, including its translations, the introduction of the electrophones category, and the Musical Instruments Museums Online (MIMO) version designed for a digital environment. The reception of Hornbostel-Sachs is analysed, and its usage, criticism and impact are all considered. As well as dominating organological research and practice for over a century, it is shown that Hornbostel-Sachs also had a significant influence on the bibliographic classification of music.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Lee","given":"Deborah"}],"citation-key":"leeHornbostelSachsClassificationMusical2020","container-title":"KNOWLEDGE ORGANIZATION","container-title-short":"KO","DOI":"10.5771/0943-7444-2020-1-72","ISSN":"0943-7444","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","page":"72-72","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Hornbostel-Sachs Classification of Musical Instruments","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nomos-elibrary.de/index.php?doi=10.5771/0943-7444-2020-1-72","volume":"47"},

Engaging with theoreticians of drama and theatre from Aristotle, Hegel, Szondi and Brecht to Barthes, Lyotard and Schechner, the book analyses the work of recent experimental theatre practitioners such as Robert Wilson, Tadeusz Kantor, Heiner Muller, The Wooster Group, Needcompany and Societas Raffaello Sanzio.\" \"This excellent translation is newly adapted for the Anglophone reader, including an introduction by Karen Jurs-Munby which provides useful theoretical and artistic contexts for the book.\"--Jacket","author":[{"family":"Lehmann","given":"Hans-Thies"},{"family":"Jürs-Munby","given":"Karen"}],"call-number":"PN2654 .L3513 2006","citation-key":"lehmannPostdramaticTheatre2006","event-place":"London ; New York","ISBN":"978-0-415-26812-7 978-0-415-26813-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006"]]},"language":"en","note":"OCLC: ocm61229777","number-of-pages":"214","publisher":"Routledge","publisher-place":"London ; New York","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Postdramatic theatre","type":"book"},

  {"id":"Levin2017","abstract":"The proxy, a decoy or surrogate, is today often used to designate a computer server acting as an intermediary for requests from clients. Originating in the Latin procurator, an agent representing others in a court of law, proxies are now emblematic of a post-democratic political age, one increasingly populated by bot militias, puppet states, and communication relays. Thus, the proxy works as a dialectical figure that is woven into the fabric of networks, where action and stance seem to be masked, calculated and remote-controlled. This publication looks at proxy-politics on both a micro and a macro level, exploring proxies as objects, as well as networks as objects. What is the relation between the molecular and the planetary? How to fathom the computational regime? Yet, whilst being a manifestation of the networked age, thinking like a proxy offers loopholes and strategies for survival within it. The Research Center for Proxy Politics (RCPP) explores and reflects upon the nature of medial networks and their actors. Between September 2014 and August 2017, the center hosted workshops, lectures and events at the Universität der Künste, Berlin, under the auspices of Hito Steyerl's Lensbased class.

Preserving the emotional history of our lives and of our species, from its very beginning music was also allied to dance, as the structure of the brain confirms; developing this neurological observation, Levitin shows how music and dance enabled the social bonding and friendship necessary for human culture and society to evolve.

  {"id":"lexerLiveElectronicsLive2012","abstract":"This thesis explores a performance practice within free improvisation. This is not a theory based improvisation – performances do not require specific preparation and the music refrains from repetition of musical structures. It engages in investigative and experimental approaches emerging from holistic considerations of acoustics, interaction and instrument, and also philosophy, psychology, sociopolitics and technology. The performance practice explores modes and approaches to working with the given potentiality of an electronically augmented acoustic instrument and involves the development of a suitably flexible computerised performance system, the piano+, combining extended techniques and real-time electroacoustic processes, which has the acoustic piano at its core. Contingencies of acoustic events and performance gestures –captured by audio analysis and sensors and combined to control the parameter space of computer processes – manipulate the fundamental properties of sound, timbre and time. Spherical abstractions, developed under consideration of Agamben’s potentiality and Sloterdijk’s philosophical theory of spheres, allow a shared metaphor for technical, instrumental, personal, and interpersonal concerns. This facilitates a theoretical approach for heuristic and investigative improvisation where performance is considered ‘Ereignis’ (an event) for sociopolitically aware activities that draw on the situational potentiality and present themselves in fragile and context dependent forms. Ever new relationships can be found and developed, but can equally be lost. Sloterdijk supplied the concept of knowledge resulting from equipping our ‘inner space’, an image suiting non-linearity of thought that transpires from Kuhl’s psychological PSI-theory to explain human motivation and behaviour.","author":[{"family":"Lexer","given":"Sebastian"}],"citation-key":"lexerLiveElectronicsLive2012","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Live Electronics in Live Performance: A Performance Practice Emerging from the piano+ used in Free Improvisation","type":"thesis"},

  {"id":"linFeelingBeatSmart2023","abstract":"Individuals who have suffered neurotrauma like a stroke or brachial plexus injury often experience reduced limb functionality. Soft robotic exoskeletons have been successful in assisting rehabilitative treatment and improving activities of daily life but restoring dexterity for tasks such as playing musical instruments has proven challenging. This research presents a soft robotic hand exoskeleton coupled with machine learning algorithms to aid in relearning how to play the piano by ‘feeling’ the difference between correct and incorrect versions of the same song. The exoskeleton features piezoresistive sensor arrays with 16 taxels integrated into each fingertip. The hand exoskeleton was created as a single unit, with polyvinyl acid (PVA) used as a stent and later dissolved to construct the internal pressure chambers for the five individually actuated digits. Ten variations of a song were produced, one that was correct and nine containing rhythmic errors. To classify these song variations, Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithms were trained with data from the 80 taxels combined from the tactile sensors in the fingertips. Feeling the differences between correct and incorrect versions of the song was done with the exoskeleton independently and while the exoskeleton was worn by a person. Results demonstrated that the ANN algorithm had the highest classification accuracy of 97.13% ± 2.00% with the human subject and 94.60% ± 1.26% without. These findings highlight the potential of the smart exoskeleton to aid disabled individuals in relearning dexterous tasks like playing musical instruments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Lin","given":"Maohua"},{"family":"Paul","given":"Rudy"},{"family":"Abd","given":"Moaed"},{"family":"Jones","given":"James"},{"family":"Dieujuste","given":"Darryl"},{"family":"Chim","given":"Harvey"},{"family":"Engeberg","given":"Erik D."}],"citation-key":"linFeelingBeatSmart2023","container-title":"Frontiers in Robotics and AI","container-title-short":"Front.

Chalmers claims, “virtual reality is a sort of genuine reality, virtual objects are real objects, and what goes on in virtual reality is truly real.” In this paper, I will suggest that the philosophical hypothesis that we might live in a simulation can be considered to be the last and most nihilistic episode in the series of narrations about the true and apparent worlds that Nietzsche sketched in The Twilight of the Idols. I will argue that Nietzsche’s prediction about the obliteration of the apparent world has actually been fulfilled by Chalmers, and I will show why his theory must be considered one of the many fables that humans have been producing in order to organise the world according to their own ends.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Longo","given":"Anna"}],"citation-key":"longoHowTrueWorld2022","container-title":"Filozofski vestnik","container-title-short":"FV","DOI":"10.3986/fv.42.2.13","ISSN":"1581-1239, 0353-4510","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,6]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"How the True World Finally Became Virtual Reality","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ojs.zrc-sazu.si/filozofski-vestnik/article/view/10627","volume":"42"},

  {"id":"loughridgeSoundingHumanMusic2023","abstract":"\"From the mid-eighteenth century on, there was a logic at work in musical discourse and practice: human or machine. That discourse defined a boundary of absolute difference between human and machine, with a recurrent practice of parsing \"human\" musicality from its \"merely mechanical\" simulations. In Sounding Human, Deirdre Loughridge tests and traverses these boundaries, unmaking the \"human or machine\" logic and seeking out others, better characterized by conjunctions such as and or with. Sounding Human enters the debate on posthumanism and human-machine relationships in music, exploring how categories of human and machine have been continually renegotiated over the centuries. Loughridge expertly traces this debate from the 1737 invention of what became the first musical android to the creation of \"sound wave instruments\" by a British electronic music composer in the 1960s, and the chopped and pitched vocals produced by sampling singers' voices in modern pop music. From music-generating computer programs to older musical instruments and music notation, Sounding Human shows how machines have always actively shaped the act of music composition. In doing so, Loughridge reveals how musical artifacts have been-or can be-used to help explain and contest what it is to be human\"--","author":[{"family":"Loughridge","given":"Deirdre"}],"call-number":"ML1050 .L68 2023","citation-key":"loughridgeSoundingHumanMusic2023","collection-title":"New material histories of music","event-place":"Chicago","ISBN":"978-0-226-83009-4 978-0-226-83011-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"number-of-pages":"238","publisher":"The University of Chicago Press","publisher-place":"Chicago","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Sounding human: music and machines, 1740/2020","title-short":"Sounding human","type":"book"},

  {"id":"MacCormack2010","abstract":"This thesis discusses my engagement with and investigation into the aesthetic and expressive possibilities of instrumental mechanism and performer- instrument physicality, while proposing an aesthetic frame inside of which purely physical events or objects can be contextualized. The relationship between the performer and their instrument is discussed at length and reimagined as being highly mediative in nature; the body and the instrument existing as autonomous operators comprising a larger machine within which they mutually exert an influence over the other. The exact points of contact between the body and the instrument are examined as if through a microscope – extremely small, precise spaces inside of which catastrophically violent physical phenomena take place. The activity within these spaces is understood as being responsible for the quality and texture of a sound, and is the point in the process of generating sound where physical, corporeal, palpable friction is transmuted into a more ephemeral aural phenomenon. The remainder of the thesis relates the information to purely musical matters, and discusses how approaching the compositional act through mechanism and physicality has led to a reversal in the hierarchy between form and content. Form and other parameters such as rhythm and meter are now issued from the organization of raw materials, rather than being de facto constructs that were generated apart from and before things like sound and physicality were considered. In the conclusion, I propose that, as a direct consequence of my research into mechanism and physicality, the roles of and the relationships between the score, performer and listener have fundamentally altered such that their confrontation with each other is the terminal, necessary factor in the piece's becoming of itself. Throughout the essay, I contextualize the ideas through their manifestation in my pieces The Restoration of Objects, Apparatus and One Flat Thing, reproduced.","author":[{"family":"MacCormack","given":"Timothy"}],"citation-key":"MacCormack2010","ISBN":"1855213656","issue":"September","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"title":"Instrumental mechanism and physicality as compositional resources","type":"document"},

The term was introduced into political theory to designate a certain nihilistic alignment of philosophical thought with the excesses of capitalist culture (or anticulture), embodied in writings that sought an immanence with this process of alienation. The uneasy status of this impulse, between subversion and acquiescence, between realist analysis and poetic exacerbation, has made accelerationism a fiercely-contested theoretical stance.","author":[{"family":"Mackay","given":"Robin"},{"family":"Avanessian","given":"Armen"}],"citation-key":"Mackay2014","container-title":"Acelerate","ISBN":"978-0-9575295-5-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"page":"1–46","publisher":"Urbanomic","title":"Acelerate: Introduction","type":"chapter"},

Why does technology attract such wildly differing responses - from fervour to boredom to distrust? Transductions explores these questions by drawing on science and technology studies, contemporary critical theory and corporeal theory. An exploration of complex technologies such as online computer games, genomic databases and the global positioning system reveals how the borders between bodies and machines, between what counts as social and what counts as technical, are no less diverse and complicated than culture itself. Indeed, they constitute a crucial dimension of contemporary culture. Through a critical analysis of the widely accepted notion that technology speeds everything up, Transductions argues that there are only ever differences in speed. The question for us now is how can such differences be represented?

  {"id":"magnusLatenciaAuralConsideraciones","abstract":"The implementation of writing as a cultural technique in the field of music enabled the development of different principles of composition and therefore helped to structure acoustic events on a two-dimensional interface (musical score). However, the sound innovations put forward by the avant-garde of the 20th Century challenged the so-called standard notation as optic representation par excellence. Many of the new musical aesthetics exceeded the classical tonal organization calling for new approaches to this medium and giving birth to numerous visualization strategies. Some of these ways of visual projection of sound included iconic (or pictorial) elements that transgressed the syntactic frame of standard music notation. The concept of Aural Latency seeks to shed some light on perceptual aspects of “iconic scores” through the discussion of contemporary writing and image theories that enable a comprehensive understanding of the hybrid nature of this medial phenomenon.","author":[{"family":"Magnus","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"magnusLatenciaAuralConsideraciones","language":"es","source":"Zotero","title":"Latencia aural.

  {"id":"maihoubThinkingSocialityArt2015","abstract":"A central theme weaving through this paper is the sociality of art objects in an essentially evolving, increasingly dynamic global art world. It examines a number of theoretical trends in anthropology concerning art production, perception, and circulation. Art objects are considered live social beings whose aesthetic value, significance, and emotional efficacy are subject to change in the course of their mobility through time and space. This paper looks at how artworks are incorporated into discourses of empowerment and advocacy, set against the emergence, growth, and intensification of networks of social relations between institutions and individuals, in a particular society and cross-culturally. It is argued that people’s engagement with artworks is reinforced by the social parameters of transactional artistic fields of visual representation. Previous knowledge about the meaning and status of an artwork induces particular interpretations and influences the aesthetic experience. Case studies from the colonial Gold Coast and contemporary Ghana discussed here demonstrate that artistic subjectivity is entangled with aesthetic and other culture-specific ideologies within a sensorial sphere of knowledge and experience. This discussion highlights the theoretical implications of a processual relativist view of the performative life of the art object for the anthropological study of art.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Maihoub","given":"Amani"}],"citation-key":"maihoubThinkingSocialityArt2015","container-title":"Journal of Aesthetics & Culture","container-title-short":"Journal of Aesthetics & Culture","DOI":"10.3402/jac.v7.25782","ISSN":"2000-4214","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"25782","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Thinking through the sociality of art objects","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3402/jac.v7.25782","volume":"7"},

The result of this operation shows the first backside sound database of the guitar.

Para David Mamet, uno de los ideólogos contemporáneos más carismáticos y comprometidos con la creación artística, el teatro con mayúsculas satisface la necesidad humana de ordenar el mundo. Una buena obra dramática lleva al protagonista a invocar frente al público, en el escenario y a través de propio personaje, la fuerza para continuar en la lucha por existir. El autor considera inherente a la naturaleza humana la necesidad de dramatizarlo todo: “Nuestra comprensión de la vida, nuestro propio drama se resume en tres partes: Había una vez... Pasaron los años... Y un día”.\nLos ensayos contenidos en Los tres usos del cuchillo actúan como un elocuente recordatorio de que las vidas privadas se componen de pequeñas escenas de tragedia y comedia que sólo tienen sentido como parte de una obra dramática que es la propia biografía en su conjunto.\nLleno de toques autobiográficos, David Mamet proporciona en este libro las claves para detectar el teatro tramposo y autocomplaciente que defiende la sociedad mediática occidental.

  {"id":"marasEmbodiedComposition2014","abstract":"Abstract\nThis thesis is a theoretical examination of the musical and artistic works and practices where physical object other than musical instrument is used in the production of musical meaning. This subject is explored within the frame of contemporary and experimental music and sound art, but the systematic overview is made from the perspec- tive of the last two genres. The focus is on explaining how physical objects acquire musical function from theoretical point of view, and what practical interventions are needed to make an object produce\na musical meaning. Objects within musical context can have various functions, and some of these functions which I considered essential, have been described and analyzed through the works by distinguished artists.\nInspiration for this text comes from the existence of discrep- ancy between the abstraction of music and corporeality of objects, which are able to exist together in the form of musical objects that I am describing. I was stimulated to think thoroughly about this topic and to summarize the observations from my own experience of playing with objects and dealing with them in my musical works. My goal was through the in-depth analysis of objects and the way of their usage, to develop a better comprehension of the the reason why for centuries artists have aimed towards the embodiment of music into physical form, and to try to spot the indications of new musical practices which are developing around these musical objects.","author":[{"family":"Maras","given":"Svletana"}],"citation-key":"marasEmbodiedComposition2014","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Aalto Universiety","title":"Embodied Composition","type":"thesis"},

  {"id":"marcoaurelioMeditaciones180","abstract":"Descendiente de una familia de origen hispánico, Marco Aurelio nació en Roma en el año 121 de nuestra era y, tras ser adoptado por Antonino Pío, lo sucedió como emperador, cargo que ocupó desde el año 161 hasta su muerte en 180. Su reinado, que ocupa la época de máxima extensión de Roma, estuvo marcado por las numerosas y dilatadas guerras que mantuvo contra los pueblos que habitaban en los límites del Imperio, sobre todo frente al Danubio. El último de los grandes emperadores Antoninos hubo de demostrar repetidamente entereza y valor a lo largo de estos veinte años; se comportó siempre como un filósofo estoico y un digno romano. Sin embargo, su devoción por las letras fue notoria, y dedicó muchas horas al estudio de la filosofía. Durante los descansos que le concedían su intensa actividad bélica y las obligaciones políticas, en las noches de vigilia de los diez últimos años de su reinado, estando de campaña, compuso las «Meditaciones», una de las principales obras del estoicismo romano, pese a estar redactadas en griego. Los doce libros que forman esta obra constituyen una compilación de ideas y sentencias breves en la que Marco Aurelio reflexiona sobre temas como los límites de la naturaleza humana, la fugacidad del tiempo, los valores morales o la manera correcta de conducirse en la vida. Las «Meditaciones» carecen de orden sistemático y consisten en los apuntes de un diario personal; Marco Aurelio no usa un tono elevado ni grandes abstracciones, sino que se dirige a sí mismo con veracidad: la grandeza que se percibe en sus escritos es real, no retórica ni literaria. Ningún otro gran personaje del mundo antiguo nos ha legado un testimonio personal tan sincero y hondo, de tanta inmediatez e intensidad.","author":[{"literal":"Marco Aurelio"}],"citation-key":"marcoaurelioMeditaciones180","contributor":[{"family":"Parker","given":"Alexander Augustine"}],"event-place":"Madrid","ISBN":"978-84-249-3896-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["180"]]},"language":"es","note":"Item ID: _:n4","number-of-pages":"215","publisher":"Editorial Gredos","publisher-place":"Madrid","title":"Meditaciones","type":"book"},

  {"id":"Marletto2016","abstract":"All current formulations of thermodynamics invoke some form of coarse-graining or ensembles as the supposed link between their own laws and the microscopic laws of motion. They deal only with ensemble-averages, expectation values, macroscopic limits, infinite heat baths, etc., not with the details of physical variables of individual microscopic systems. They are consistent with the laws of motion for finite systems only in certain approximations, which improve with increasing scale, given various assumptions about initial conditions which are neither specified precisely nor even thought to hold exactly in nature. Here I propose a new formulation of the zeroth, first and second laws, improving upon the axiomatic approach to thermodynamics (Carathéodory, 1909; Lieb & Yngvason, 1999), via the principles of the recently proposed constructor theory. Specifically, I provide a non-approximative, scale-independent formulation of 'adiabatic accessibility'; this in turn provides a non-approximative, scale-independent distinction between work and heat and reveals an unexpected connection between information theory and the first law of thermodynamics (not just the second). It also achieves the long-sought unification of the axiomatic approach with Kelvin's.","author":[{"family":"Marletto","given":"Chiara"}],"citation-key":"Marletto2016","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"page":"1–30","title":"Constructor theory of thermodynamics","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.02625"},

  {"id":"martinezMatematicasMetastasisXenakis2016","abstract":"In the music of Xenakis, integration largely reflects the fact that ideas come from a single, rather than multiple spirits. Xenakis’s understanding of the languages and techniques of music and architecture as well as his professional training in mathematics have lead him to discover principles and procedures that are analogous across the three disciplines. Following this, translations between domains provide a unique feature to some his compositions. This paper explores interdisciplinary connections in Metastasis. The two outer sections of the piece are one of the first historical examples of sound mass composition. They are not based on the contemporary compositional trend, but rather on resources taken from a geometry that is completely unrelated to music theory. The central section is different inasmuch as it is an extension of the multiserial theories that Xenaxis learned from Messiaen but modified according to the concepts of permutation and combination taken from mathematics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Martinez","given":"Edgardo"}],"citation-key":"martinezMatematicasMetastasisXenakis2016","container-title":"Revista del ISM","container-title-short":"ISM","DOI":"10.14409/ism.v0i16.6088","ISSN":"2362-3322, 1666-7603","issue":"16","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",8,4]]},"language":"es","page":"157-180","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Las Matemáticas en Metástasis de Xenakis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://bibliotecavirtual.unl.edu.ar/publicaciones/index.php/ISM/article/view/6088"},

Actively linked to the experimental artists of the Instituto Di Tella, he proposed a series of key notions such asdematerialization, discontinuity and atmosphere to understand radical mutations of art. The first edition of this book, twelve years ago, intended as a call to attention before a clear oblivion: Masotta texts on art were unattainable and barely read. Although he was highly regarded in the Argentine intellectual field as a literary critic and especially as introducer of Lacan in psychoanalysis in Latin America and Spain, his multiple roles and intervention territories remained fragmented and compartmentalized, far from from composing an articulate intellectual itinerary. This volume reedits the almost lost texts written by Masotta on artistic issues in the 1960's, included in his books \"El pop art\" (1965), \"Happenings\" (1967) and \"Conciencia y estructura\" (1968), as well as other dispersed writings","author":[{"family":"Masotta","given":"Oscar"},{"family":"Longoni","given":"Ana"}],"call-number":"N6494.P6 M33 2017","citation-key":"masottaRevolucionArtePopart2017","collection-title":"Campo real","edition":"Primera edición","event-place":"Buenos Aires","ISBN":"978-987-3728-48-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"es","number-of-pages":"258","publisher":"Mansalva","publisher-place":"Buenos Aires","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Revolución en el arte: pop-art, happenings y arte de los medios en la década del sesenta","title-short":"Revolución en el arte","type":"book"},

Work in sound studies continues to seek out sound \"itself\"--but, today, when the aesthetic can claim no autonomy and the agency of both artist and audience is socially constituted, why not explore the social mediation already present within our experience of the sonorous' In this work, artist, musician, performer, and theorist Mattin sets out an understanding of alienation as a constitutive part of subjectivity and as an enabling condition for exploring social dissonance--the discrepancy between our individual narcissism and our social capacity. Mattin's theoretical investigation is intertwined with documentation of a concrete experiment in the form of an instructional score (performed at documenta 14, 2017, in Athens and Kassel) which explores these conceptual connotations in practice, as players use members of the audience as instruments, who then hear themselves and reflect on their own conception and self-presentation. Social Dissonance claims that, by amplifying alienation in performance and participation in order to understand how we are constructed through various forms of mediation, we can shift the emphasis from the sonic to the social, and in doing so, discover for ourselves that social dissonance is the territory within which we already find ourselves, the condition we inhabit","author":[{"family":"Mattin","given":""}],"citation-key":"mattinSocialDissonance2022","contributor":[{"family":"Brassier","given":"Ray"}],"event-place":"Cambridge","ISBN":"978-1-913029-86-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"eng","note":"OCLC: 1319222905","publisher":"Urbanomic","publisher-place":"Cambridge","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Social dissonance","type":"book"},

The present theory includes a formal language for musical and musicological objects and relations. This language is built upon topos theory and its logic. Various models of musical phenomena have been developed. They include harmony (function theory, cadences, and modulations), classical counterpoint (Fux rules), rhythm, motif theory, and the theory of musical performance. Most of these models have also been implemented and evaluated in computer applications. Some models have been tested empirically in neuro-musicology and the cognitive science of music. The mathematical nature of this modeling process canonically embedds the given historical music theories in a variety of ﬁctitious theories and thereby enables a qualiﬁcation of historical reality against potential variants. As a result, the historical realizations often turn out to be some kind of “best possible world” and thus reveals a type of “anthropic principle” in music.","author":[{"family":"Mazzola","given":"Guerino"}],"citation-key":"mazzolaMathematicalMusicTheory2000","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Mathematical music theory","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"mccormackInstrumentalMechanismPhysicality2010","abstract":"This thesis discusses my engagement with and investigation into the aesthetic and expressive possibilities of instrumental mechanism and performerinstrument physicality, while proposing an aesthetic frame inside of which purely physical events or objects can be contextualized. The relationship between the performer and their instrument is discussed at length and reimagined as being highly mediative in nature; the body and the instrument existing as autonomous operators comprising a larger machine within which they mutually exert an influence over the other. The exact points of contact between the body and the instrument are examined as if through a microscope – extremely small, precise spaces inside of which catastrophically violent physical phenomena take place. The activity within these spaces is understood as being responsible for the quality and texture of a sound, and is the point in the process of generating sound where physical, corporeal, palpable friction is transmuted into a more ephemeral aural phenomenon. The remainder of the thesis relates the information to purely musical matters, and discusses how approaching the compositional act through mechanism and physicality has led to a reversal in the hierarchy between form and content. Form and other parameters such as rhythm and meter are now issued from the organization of raw materials, rather than being de facto constructs that were generated apart from and before things like sound and physicality were considered. In the conclusion, I propose that, as a direct consequence of my research into mechanism and physicality, the roles of and the relationships between the score, performer and listener have fundamentally altered such that their confrontation with each other is the terminal, necessary factor in the piece’s becoming of itself. Throughout the essay, I contextualize the ideas through their manifestation in my pieces The Restoration of Objects, Apparatus and One Flat Thing, reproduced.","author":[{"family":"Mccormack","given":"Timothy"}],"citation-key":"mccormackInstrumentalMechanismPhysicality2010","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Instrumental Mechanism and Physicality as Compositional Resources","type":"thesis"},

  {"id":"McGonigal2012a","abstract":"(from the jacket) More than 174 million Americans are gamers, and the average young person in the United States will spend ten thousand hours gaming by the age of twenty-one. According to world-renowned game designer Jane McGonigal, the reason for this mass exodus to virtual worlds is that video games are increasingly fulfilling genuine human needs. In this groundbreaking exploration of the power and future of gaming, McGonigal reveals how we can use the lessons of game design to fix what is wrong with the real world. Drawing on positive psychology, cognitive science, and sociology. Reality Is Broken uncovers how game designers have hit on core truths about what makes us happy and have utilized these discoveries to astonishing effect in virtual environments. Video games consistently provide the exhilarating rewards, stimulating challenges, and epic victories that are so often lacking in the real world. But why, McGonigal asks, should we use the power of games for escapist entertainment alone? Her research suggests that gamers are expert problem solvers and collaborators, since they cooperate with other players to overcome daunting virtual challenges, and she helped pioneer a fast-growing genre of games that aims to turn gameplay to socially positive ends. In Reality Is Broken, she reveals how these new alternate reality games are already improving the quality of our daily lives, fighting social problems like depression and obesity, and addressing vital twenty-first-century challengesand she forecasts the thrilling possibilities that lie ahead. She introduces us to games like World Without Oil, a simulation designed to brainstormand therefore avertthe challenges of a worldwide oil shortage, and EVOKE, a game commissioned by the World Bank Institute, which sends players on missions to address issues from poverty to climate change. McGonigal persuasively argues that those who continue to dismiss games will be at a major disadvantage in the coming years. Gamers, on the other hand, will be able to leverage the collaborative and motivational power of games in their own lives, communities, and businesses. Written for gamers and non-gamers alike, Reality Is Broken shows us that the future will belong to those who can understand, design, and play games.

In music, vocables are words that describe musical sounds, by relating vocal movements to articulations of a musical instrument.

  {"id":"melbyeResistanceMasteryAgency2021","abstract":"In this article I describe the development of a performance practice with a new electroacoustic instrument – the FAAB (feedback-actuated augmented bass). Drawing on a background in improvisation, I discuss how the feedback-induced behaviour of the instrument sets it apart from an acoustic bass and how the implementation of operationally closed digital signal processing algorithms facilitates greater systemic autonomy. In identifying resistance as a key feature of improvisation, I propose the term ‘diachronic mastery’ as a way of addressing the equilibration of sensorimotor schemes in the context of developing a performance practice with a complex hybrid system such as the FAAB. Through a discussion of the term ‘agency’ as it appears in recent literature, I develop a preliminary framework for addressing both the immediate experience of agency emerging in performance ecosystems and the biologically informed definition of the term that may be useful in the design of increasingly autonomous instruments and performance systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Melbye","given":"Adam Pultz"}],"citation-key":"melbyeResistanceMasteryAgency2021","container-title":"Organised Sound","container-title-short":"Org.

  {"id":"meyerFluteMusicalBows2021","abstract":"The Gavião, a native Amazonian group in Rondônia, Brazil, use three different traditional musical instruments that they identify as “speaking” ones and that are characterized by a very tight music-lyric relation through similar pitch patterns: a flute (called\n              kotiráp\n              ), a pair of mouth bows (\n              iridináp\n              ), and three large bamboo clarinets (\n              totoráp\n              ), played by three different players, each one playing a single-note clarinet. They show in different ways the relation of acoustic iconicity which exists between the words of the songs’ lyrics and the music played on such instruments to “sing” the songs. Linguistic analysis makes it possible to understand the phonetic and phonological nature of the iconicity. The sung speech form, being intermediate between the spoken and the instrumental forms, is useful for both learning and explaining the musical notes. In a language with distinctive tone and length, such as Gavião of Rondônia, the first question about speech that is played by musical instruments is the relation between the melodies and the supersegmental phonology of the corresponding words in sung speech and in modal spoken speech. It is influenced by the phonological possibilities of the spoken form and by the musical possibilities of the instrumental form. The description and analysis of Gavião instrumental speech and song practices are found to be a noteworthy contribution to the typology of instrumental language surrogates associated with a tone language, one that calls for a reexamination of hypotheses about which aspects of the phonological/phonetic structure can be transposed in instrumental speech and how this can be done. The role of this kind of instrumental sung speech is artistic and also practical as it contributes to maintain the oral heritage. Such practice represents a little-studied and threatened cultural heritage of the traditional substratum of the cultures of Amazonia.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Meyer","given":"Julien"},{"family":"Moore","given":"Denny"}],"citation-key":"meyerFluteMusicalBows2021","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front.

  {"id":"michailsTacticalInterventionsEnvironmental2017","abstract":"Restless with my artistic output of participatory gallery-based installations that engaged audiences about broader issues around energy and resources in crisis, I’ve recently shifted my practice toward working directly with communities in addressing their local environmental problems. Appropriating the popularity of citizen science and do-it-yourself making as tactics for engagement, this new work builds upon an important history of engineered artworks and activist strategies to make environmental sensing devices with community participants. Airtracs is a two-year community-based project that uses electronic toys as a starting point for dialogue and hands-on learning about the cradle-to-grave life cycle of electronics. The project then progresses to air quality monitoring, augmenting remote control toy trucks (rovers) equipped with cellular networking and inexpensive sensors to push data to a server. The rovers are created by youth participants living in an environmental justice community with a long-time struggle with the City of Albany and the State of New York to reduce the air pollution in their neighbourhood. Building upon a history of similar art and activist initiatives, this paper demonstrates how these community-based projects challenge regulatory standards in air quality assessment, confronting the controversies and critical issues revolving around calibration and data quality of low-cost sensing devices.","author":[{"family":"Michails","given":"Maria"}],"citation-key":"michailsTacticalInterventionsEnvironmental2017","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Tactical Interventions: Environmental Sensing and Socially-Engaged Arts","type":"article-journal"},

We examine techniques to carry out these estimates using a database of impulse responses from 3D printed models and a custom algorithm for mode interpolation within a geometrical matrix. Test geometries are organized as a function of their physical characteristics and placed into a multidimensional space/matrix whose boundaries are deﬁned by the objects at each corner. Finite Element Analyses is integrated into the open-source CAD environment to provide estimates of material vibrations also compared to measurements on the fabricated counterparts. Finally, predicted parameters inform physical models for aural comparisons between fabricated targets and computational estimates. These hybrid methods are reliable for predicting early modes as they covary with changes in scale and shape in our test matrix.","author":[{"family":"Michon","given":"Romain"},{"family":"Chafe","given":"Chris"},{"family":"Granzow","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"michon3DPrintingPhysical2018","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"3D Printing and Physical Modeling of Musical Instruments: Casting the Net","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"misesSocialismo1922","abstract":"El Socialismo —escribe Friedrich A. Hayek— constituye la aportación más decisiva de Ludwig von Mises. Cuando apareció por primera vez en 1922, «su impacto fue muy profundo. Alteró gradual, pero fundamentalmente, la perspectiva de toda una generación y desafió el pensamiento de muchos jóvenes idealistas». Con esta obra, ya clásica, Ludwig von Mises, en palabras de François Perroux, «ha aportado una contribución excepcional a la crítica del socialismo». Pero Socialismo es mucho más que una simple crítica al socialismo en sus diversas formas. Su ambición va mucho más allá de demostrar que una sociedad construida al margen del mercado es inviable porque en ella es imposible el cálculo económico y por consiguiente la solución racional de los problemas económicos. Para poder fundamentar su crítica, Mises se adentra en los campos, no sólo de la economía, sino también de la sociología, la filosofía y la historia, haciendo gala de una prodigiosa información en el análisis de problemas radicales como los de la propiedad, la producción y la distribución, la posición del individuo en la sociedad, la naturaleza de la colaboración social, la estructura de la acción humana, la evolución histórica, la función de los intereses y los ideales, la relación entre socialismo e instituciones sociales, entre socialismo y ética, la relación histórica entre socialismo y fascismo, entre socialismo y liberalismo y varios más: toda una teoría de la sociedad, con plena vigencia en la actualidad, a pesar de ciertas apreciaciones coyunturales sobre el socialismo dominante en su tiempo y a pesar también de las transformaciones que el socialismo ha experimentado en los últimos cincuenta años y del abandono de muchos de sus dogmas.","author":[{"family":"Mises","given":"Ludwig","dropping-particle":"von"}],"citation-key":"misesSocialismo1922","issued":{"date-parts":[["1922",1,1]]},"language":"es","note":"Item ID: _:n4","publisher":"ePubLibre","title":"Socialismo","type":"book"},

A través de los apuntes personales de un psicoanalista, tenemos noticias del caso de una paciente para quien la música es una metáfora del placer sexual, de suerte que no puede «oír» música durante sus relaciones sexuales, esto es, no conoce el orgasmo. Paciente y médico establecen una relación sensualmente detectivesca que constituye una crítica del psicoanálisis establecido y, al mismo tiempo, un ambicioso intento de revisar mediante ejemplos concretos, fruto de la imaginación e inquietud del autor, qué significa el concepto de amor absoluto.

After the introduction, there is a brief history of speculation in radically different contexts, followed by a broad overview of speculative design practice and education. From there we dive into speculative design approaches, methods, and tools through a series of detailed case studies written by the practitioners themselves. A summary of critical views on speculative practice over the past two decades follows, and we conclude with a suggestion of future paths and a list of guidelines (towards good practice) for both educators and speculative designers.We hope that this book will provide newcomers with a thorough introduction to the past, present and future of speculative design and related approaches. Experienced practitioners will have the opportunity to check in and learn more about diverse approaches, methods and tools, as well as case studies; some of which – due to the radical heterogeneity and interdisciplinary of the field – they may not have previously been aware of.

The analysis of Ben-Zvi emphasized the preeminence achieved by the body in our Irish author’s work. she also infers that it could be even more relevant in his writing than the mind, which for most critics defines the Beckettian subject of knowledge. This essay intends to explore how representations of disgust integrate the melancholic dynamics in Samuel Beckett’s work and how they play an obliged role in his solitary and abstracted characters’ withdrawal. External images in Samuel Beckett´s first poems and prose refer to a traumatic experience of bleakness, suffering and neglect. Beckett’s subjects don’t react to this in an active way nor evaluate the possibility of becoming agents of change; in fact, we realize that they are constrained to play a role that forces them to inaction and rumination.","author":[{"family":"Montes","given":"Elina"}],"citation-key":"montesMontonCosasRepugnantes2014","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"language":"es","source":"Zotero","title":"Un montón de cosas repugnantes: rechazo y melancolía en la obra de Samuel Beckett","type":"article-journal"},

Due to the hyperbolic topology of the isofrequency surface in HMMs, the so-called resonance cone direction exists, and as a result, propagation of quasi-electrostatic waves, or more commonly, electrostatic waves close to the resonance cone with large wave vectors, is possible. However, the investigation of electrostatic wave properties in HMMs is largely overlooked in most works on the subject, and the purpose of this monograph is to fill this gap. This book gives a thorough theoretical treatment of propagation, reflection, and refraction of electrostatic waves in HMMs of various dimensions and geometries.

Especialmente na Ilíada, temos grandes cenas de guerra atravessadas por momentos de conflitos individuais e confrontos face a face. Entre o macro e o micro, entre o mundo dos deuses e dos homens, ouve-se uma voz, um som que nos projeta para\nalém de nós mesmos: é a voz do rapsodo, em seu trabalho multissensorial. Neste livro o fascínio por essa dramaturgia ampla é discutido a partir do encontro entre Estudos Clássicos, Estudos do Som e Performance. Tal intercruzamento de fronteiras procura clarificar a dimensão plural da atividade do rapsodo na produção de suas audiocenas, ou eventos interativos imaginativos sonoramente orientados. Após uma detida análise dessa atividade registrada na épica homérica, apresenta-se o experimento narrativo de Heliodoro que, em As Etiópicas, procura competir com todas as obras da tradição clássica, produzindo uma fusão experimental de gêneros. Esta releitura de Homero e da tradição clássica impulsionou diversos artistas, tais como Cervantes, Shakespeare e Verdi. Enfim, nos passos de Homero caminhamos.","author":[{"family":"Mota","given":"Marcus"}],"citation-key":"motaAudiocenasInterfaceEntre2020","event-place":"Brasília, DF","ISBN":"978-65-5846-035-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,9]]},"language":"pt","number-of-pages":"218","publisher":"Editora Universidade de Brasília","publisher-place":"Brasília, DF","source":"Câmara Brasileira do Livro ISBN","title":"Audiocenas: Interface entre Cultura Clássica, Dramaturgia e Sonoridades","title-short":"Audiocenas","type":"book"},

  {"id":"Mullarkey2012","abstract":"Gilles Deleuze (1925–95) was Professor of Philosophy at the University of Vincennes in Saint-Denis from 1969 to 1987. He published extensively on the history of philosophy and on the concepts of the arts. His books include Empiricism and Subjectivity (1953; English trans. 1991), Proust and Signs (1964; English trans. 2000), Bergsonism (1966; English trans. 1988), Diff erence and Repetition (1968; English trans. 1994), Spinoza and the Problem of Expression (1968; English trans. 1988), Francis Bacon (1981; English trans. 2003), Cinema 1 (1983; English trans. 1986), Cinema 2 (1985; English trans. 1989); Foucault (1986; English trans. 1988) and The Fold (1988; English trans. 1993). In collaboration with the political psychoanalyst Félix Guattari he co- authored a number of works, including Anti- Oedipus (1972; English trans. 1977), Kafka (1975; English trans. 1986), A Thousand Plateaus (1980; English trans. 1987) and What is Philosophy? (1991; English trans. 1994). Of all the film-philosophies of the twentieth century, it is perhaps Deleuze's that is most of the cinema. By that I mean that it attempts to belong to cinema rather than simply be about it. It shows us film thinking for itself. The magnanimity Deleuze shows to film's conceptual power is seen most clearly at the very end of his two-volume work on film (Cinema 1: The Movement-Image and Cinema 2: The Time-Image) when he writes that “cinema's concepts are not given in cinema. And yet they are cinema's concepts, not theories about cinema.”","author":[{"family":"Mullarkey","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"Mullarkey2012","container-title":"Film, theory and philosophy: The key thinkers","DOI":"10.7202/039049ar","ISBN":"978-1-84465-440-6","ISSN":"0023-9054","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"page":"179–189","publisher":"Rou","title":"Gilles deleuze","type":"chapter"},

La reducción de la tasa de natalidad, la inmigración masiva y un sentimiento de disgusto y de odio se han conjugado para hacer que los europeos sean incapaces de debatir entre ellos y se resistan a comprender los cambios existentes en su sociedad.<br/> Este libro no es solamente un análisis de la demografía y de las realidades políticas, sino también un relato testimonial de un continente en proceso de autodestrucción. La obra incluye reportajes de todo el continente, desde los lugares en donde los emigrantes desembarcaron hasta aquellos otros en los que termina su aventura; desde la gente que parece darles la bienvenida hasta aquella otra que no quiere recibirlos.

Basta con seguir las redes sociales o los medios de comunicación para ser testigos de la histeria colectiva en la que se ha convertido el debate político. Cada día alguien nuevo clama que algo le ha ofendido: un cartel que cosifica, una conferencia que debe ser censurada, una palabra que degrada. Vivimos en la tiranía de la corrección política, en un mundo sin género, ni razas ni sexo y en el que proliferan las personas que se confiesan víctimas de algo (el heteropatriarcado, la bifobia o el racismo). Ser víctima es ya una aspiración, una etiqueta que nos eleva moralmente y que nos ahorra tener que argumentar nada. Pero como nos recuerda Douglas Murray en este polémico libro que ha sido menospreciado por la izquierda biempensante y que se ha con - vertido en un fenómeno de ventas sin precedente en el Reino Unido: «La víctima no siempre tiene razón, no siempre tiene que caernos bien, no siempre merece elogio y, de hecho, no siempre es víctima».

  {"id":"Musgrave1993","abstract":"There are five fundamental concerns in the synthesis of realistic imagery of fractal landscapes: 1) convincing geometric models of terrain; 2) efficient algorithms for rendering those potentially-large terrain models; 3) atmospheric effects, or aerial perspective, to provide a sense of scale; 4) surface textures as models of natural phenomena such as clouds, water, rock strata, and so forth, to enhance visual detail in the image beyond what can be modelled geometrically; and 5) a global context in which to situate the scenes. Results in these five areas are presented, and some aspects of the development of computer graphics as a new process and medium for the fine arts are discussed. Heterogeneous terrain models are introduced, and preliminary experiments in simulating fluvial erosion are presented to provide fractal drainage network features. For imaging detailed terrain models we describe grid tracing, a time- and memory-efficient algorithm for ray tracing height fields. To obtain aerial perspective we develop geometric models of aerosol density distributions with efficient integration schemes for determining scattering and extinction, and an efficient Rayleigh scattering approximation. We also describe physically-based models of the rainbow and mirage. Proceduralism is an underlying theme of this work; this is the practice of abstracting models of complex form and behaviors into relatively terse algorithms, which are evaluated in a lazy fashion. Procedural textures are developed as models of natural phenomena such as mountains and clouds, culminating a procedural model of an Earth-like planet which in the future may be explored interactively in a virtual reality setting.","author":[{"family":"Musgrave","given":"Forest Kenton"}],"citation-key":"Musgrave1993","container-title":"Thesis","issued":{"date-parts":[["1993"]]},"page":"1–276","title":"Methods for realistic landscape imaging","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.kenmusgrave.com/dissertation.pdf"},

  {"id":"nakamotoBitcoinPeertoPeerElectronic2008","abstract":"A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.","author":[{"family":"Nakamoto","given":"Satoshi"}],"citation-key":"nakamotoBitcoinPeertoPeerElectronic2008","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"nestorBreathNewScience2020","abstract":"\"No matter what you eat, how much you exercise, how resilient your genes are, how skinny or young or wise you are, none of it matters if you're not breathing properly. There is nothing more essential to our health and wellbeing than breathing: take air in, let it out, repeat 25,000 times a day. Yet, as a species, humans have lost the ability to breathe correctly, with grave consequences. Science journalist James Nestor travels the world to figure out what went wrong with our breathing and how to fix it. Why are we the only animals with chronically crooked teeth? Why didn't our ancestors snore? Nestor seeks out answers in muddy digs of ancient burial sites, secret Soviet facilities, New Jersey choir schools, and the smoggy streets of Sao Paulo, Brazil. He tracks down men and women exploring the science behind ancient breathing practices like Pranayama, Sudarshan Kriya, and Tummo and teams up with pulmonary tinkerers to scientifically test long-held beliefs about how we breathe. Modern research is showing us that changing the ways in which we breathe can jump-start athletic performance, halt snoring, rejuvenate internal organs, mute allergies and asthma, blunt autoimmune disease, and straighten scoliotic spines. None of this should be possible, and yet it is. Drawing on thousands of years of medical texts and recent cutting-edge studies in pulmonology, psychology, biochemistry, and human physiology, Breath turns the conventional wisdom of what we thought we knew about our most basic biological function on its head. You will never breathe the same again\"--","author":[{"family":"Nestor","given":"James"}],"call-number":"RA782","citation-key":"nestorBreathNewScience2020","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-0-7352-1363-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"number-of-pages":"1","publisher":"Riverhead Books","publisher-place":"New York","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Breath: the new science of a lost art","title-short":"Breath","type":"book"},

  {"id":"Nika2016","abstract":"This thesis focuses on the introduction of authoring and controls in human-computer music improvisation through the use of tempo- ral scenarios to guide or compose interactive performances, and ad- dresses the dialectic between planning and reactivity in interactive music systems dedicated to improvisation. An interactive system dedicated to music improvisation generates music “on the fly”, in relation to the musical context of a live perfor- mance. This work follows on researches on machine improvisation seen as the navigation through a musical memory: typically the mu- sic played by an “analog” musician co-improvising with the system during a performance or an offline corpus. These researches were mainly dedicated to free improvisation, and we focus here on pulsed and “idiomatic” music. Within an idiomatic context, an improviser deals with issues of ac- ceptability regarding the stylistic norms and aesthetic values implic- itly carried by the musical idiom. This is also the case for an interac- tive music system that would like to play jazz, blues, or rock... with- out being limited to imperative rules that would not allowany kind of transgression or digression. Various repertoires of improvised music rely on a formalized and temporally structured object, for example a harmonic progression in jazz improvisation. The same way, the mod- els and architecture we developed rely on a formal temporal struc- ture. This structure does not carry the narrative dimension of the improvisation, that is its fundamentally aesthetic and non-explicit evolution, but is a sequence of formalized constraints for the ma- chine improvisation. This thesis thus presents: a music generation model guided by a “scenario” introducing mechanisms of anticipation; a framework to compose improvised interactive performances at the “scenario” level; an architecture combining anticipatory be- havior with reactivity using mixed static/dynamic scheduling tech- niques; an audio rendering module to perform live re-injection of captured material in synchrony with a non-metronomic beat; a study carried out with ten musicians through performances, work sessions, listening sessions and interviews. First, First, we propose a music generation model guided by a formal structure. In this framework “improvising” means navigating through an indexed memory to collect some contiguous or disconnected sequences matching the successive parts of a “scenario” guiding the improvisation (for example a chord progression). The musical pur- pose ofthe scenario is to ensure the conformity ofthe improvisations generated by the machine to the idiom it carries, and to introduce anticipation mechanisms in the generation process, by analogy with a musician anticipating the resolution of a harmonic progression. Using the formal genericity of the couple “scenario / memory”, we sketch a protocol to compose improvisation sessions at the scenario level. Defining scenarios described using audio-musical descriptors or any user-defined alphabet can lead to approach others dimen- sions of guided interactive improvisation. In this framework, musi- cians for whom the definition of a musical alphabet and the design of scenarios for improvisation is part of the creative process can be involved upstream, in the “meta-level of composition” consisting in the design of the musical language of the machine. This model can be used in a compositional workflow and is “of- fline” in the sense that one run produces a whole timed and struc- tured musical gesture satisfying the designed scenario that will then be unfolded through time during performance. We present then a dy- namic architecture embedding such generation processes with for- mal specifications in order to combine anticipation and reactivity in a context of guided improvisation. In this context, a reaction of the system to the external environment, such as control interfaces or live players input, cannot only be seen as a spontaneous instant re- sponse. Indeed, it has to take advantage ofthe knowledge ofthis tem- poral structure to benefit from anticipatory behavior. A reaction can be considered as a revision of mid-term anticipations, musical se- quences previously generated by the system ahead of the time of the performance, in the light ofnew events or controls. To cope with the issue of combining long-term planning and reactivity, we therefore propose to model guided improvisation as dynamic calls to “compo- sitional” processes, that it to say to embed intrinsically offline genera- tion models in a reactive architecture. In order to be able to play with the musicians, and with the sound of the musicians, this architec- ture includes a novel audio rendering module that enables to impro- vise by re-injecting live audio material (processed and transformed online to match the scenario) in synchrony with a non-metronomic fluctuating pulse. Finally, this work fully integrated the results of frequent interac- tions with expert musicians to the iterative design of the models and architectures. These latter are implemented in the interactive music system ImproteK, one of the offspring of the OMax system, that was used at various occasions during live performances with improvis- ers. During these collaborations, work sessions were associated to listening sessions and interviews to gather the evaluations ofthe mu- sicians on the system in order to validate and refine the scientific and technological choices.","author":[{"family":"Nika","given":"Jérôme"}],"citation-key":"Nika2016","genre":"phd","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"publisher":"Université Pierre et Marie Curie","title":"Guiding human-computer music improvisation: introducing authoring and control with temporal scenarios","type":"thesis"},

  {"id":"nilssonImmersionRevisitedReview2016","abstract":"The term immersion continues to be applied inconsistently within and across different fields of research connected with the study of virtual reality and interactive media. Moreover, immersion is oftentimes used interchangeably with the terms presence and engagement. This article details a review of existing definitions of immersion originating within the study of video games, virtual environments, and literary works of fiction. Based on this review, a three-dimensional taxonomy of the various conceptualizations of immersion is proposed. That is, the existing definitions of immersion may be broadly divided into three categories, each representing a dimension of the taxonomy: immersion as a property of a system, a subjective response to narrative contents, or a subjective response to challenges within the virtual environment. Finally, four distinct theories of presence are introduced and, based on the established taxonomy, we discuss how the individual theories relate to existing definitions of immersion.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Nilsson","given":"Niels Christian"},{"family":"Nordahl","given":"Rolf"},{"family":"Serafin","given":"Stefania"}],"citation-key":"nilssonImmersionRevisitedReview2016","container-title":"Human Technology","container-title-short":"Human Technology","DOI":"10.17011/ht/urn.201611174652","ISSN":"17956889","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",11,30]]},"language":"en","page":"108-134","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Immersion Revisited: A review of existing definitions of immersion and their relation to different theories of presence","title-short":"Immersion Revisited","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://humantechnology.jyu.fi/archive/vol-12/issue-2/immersion-revisited","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"normanDesignEverydayThings2013","abstract":"Even the smartest among us can feel inept as we fail to figure out which light switch or oven burner to turn on, or whether to push, pull, or slide a door. The fault, argues this ingenious-even liberating-book, lies not in ourselves, but in product design that ignores the needs of users and the principles of cognitive psychology. The problems range from ambiguous and hidden controls to arbitrary relationships between controls and functions, coupled with a lack of feedback or other assistance and unreasonable demands on memorization. The Design of Everyday Things shows that good, usable design is possible. The rules are simple : make things visible, exploit natural relationships that couple function and control, and make intelligent use of constraints. The goal : guide the user effortlessly to the right action on the right control at the right time. In this entertaining and insightful analysis, cognitive scientist Don Norman hails excellence of design as the most important key to regaining the competitive edge in influencing consumer behavior. Now fully expanded and updated, with a new introduction by the author, The Design of Everyday Things is a powerful primer on how-and why-some products satisfy customers while others only frustrate them.","author":[{"family":"Norman","given":"Donald A."}],"citation-key":"normanDesignEverydayThings2013","edition":"Rev. and expanded edition","event-place":"Cambridge (Mass.)","ISBN":"978-0-465-05065-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"MIT press","publisher-place":"Cambridge (Mass.)","source":"BnF ISBN","title":"The design of everyday things","type":"book"},

  {"id":"nowozinFGANTrainingGenerative2016","abstract":"Generative neural samplers are probabilistic models that implement sampling using feedforward neural networks: they take a random input vector and produce a sample from a probability distribution defined by the network weights. These models are expressive and allow efficient computation of samples and derivatives, but cannot be used for computing likelihoods or for marginalization. The generative-adversarial training method allows to train such models through the use of an auxiliary discriminative neural network. We show that the generative-adversarial approach is a special case of an existing more general variational divergence estimation approach. We show that any f-divergence can be used for training generative neural samplers. We discuss the benefits of various choices of divergence functions on training complexity and the quality of the obtained generative models.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Nowozin","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Cseke","given":"Botond"},{"family":"Tomioka","given":"Ryota"}],"citation-key":"nowozinFGANTrainingGenerative2016","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.1606.00709","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",6,2]]},"number":"arXiv:1606.00709","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"f-GAN: Training Generative Neural Samplers using Variational Divergence Minimization","title-short":"f-GAN","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00709"},

The first task of the paper is to analytically decode AR game using the idea of cybernetics and John Cormack's creative ecosystem. Side by side this immanent exposition is the unmasking of such creative ecosystem that brings to light Jean Baudrillard's idea of hyperreality.

  {"id":"nyeSoftPowerMeans2004","abstract":"Joseph Nye coined the term \"soft power\" in the late 1980s. It is now used frequentlyand often incorrectlyby political leaders, editorial writers, and academics around the world. So what is soft power? Soft power lies in the ability to attract and persuade. Whereas hard powerthe ability to coercegrows out of a country's military or economic might, soft power arises from the attractiveness of a country's culture, political ideals, and policies. Hard power remains crucial in a world of states trying to guard their independence and of non-state groups willing to turn to violence. It forms the core of the Bush administration's new national security strategy. But according to Nye, the neo-conservatives who advise the president are making a major miscalculation: They focus too heavily on using America's military power to force other nations to do our will, and they pay too little heed to our soft power. It is soft power that will help prevent terrorists from recruiting supporters from among the moderate majority. And it is soft power that will help us deal with critical global issues that require multilateral cooperation among states. That is why it is so essential that America better understands and applies our soft power.

Over time, several eminent scientists, musicians, and artists have tried to establish correspondences between sound and vision. Some of these efforts were based on scientific principles, some on genuine synesthetic experiences, while others were more obviously creative aesthetic choices. With the resurgence of interest in this field, the argument presented here is that now is the time to re-evaluate this canon of knowledge, to identify more clearly, and expand the core concepts at its center. A selection of works, by pioneering film makers from the twentieth century, are examined from a semiotically informed perspective, to reevaluate some of the history of Visual Music alongside new ideas from the adjacent fields of science, psychology, and neuroscience. To this end a range of principles/parameters are outlined that arguably constitute the fundamentals of all creative approaches that translate between sound and vision going forward.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,28]]},"author":[{"family":"O’Neill","given":"Shaleph"}],"citation-key":"oneillSemioticsVisualMusic2023","container-title":"The Intermediality of Contemporary Visual Arts","DOI":"10.5772/intechopen.110777","editor":[{"family":"López-Varela Azcárate","given":"Asun"}],"ISBN":"978-1-80355-858-5 978-1-80355-859-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,22]]},"language":"en","publisher":"IntechOpen","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Towards a Semiotics of Visual Music","type":"chapter","URL":"https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/86642"},

  {"id":"onofreiBowingVirtualStrings2022","abstract":"We present a music interface implementing a bowed string. The bow is realised using a commercially available haptic device, consisting of a stylus attached to a robotic arm. While playing the virtual strings with the stylus reproducing the bow, users feel both the elastic force from the strings and the friction resulting from the interaction with their surfaces. The audio-haptic feedback is obtained by a physical model: four stiff strings are simulated using a ﬁnite difference time domain method, modelled as 1-Delements in the virtual 3-D space. The bow is simply modelled as a rigid cylinder that can move free in this space, and interact with the strings. Finally, the frictional interaction between such elements is modelled by a nonlinear friction model capable of reproducing the characteristic stick-slip phenomenon observed during string bowing. Moreover, the model can be dynamically controlled in one parameter so as to become more sticky or slippery. By turning on and off the frictional feedback, users can appreciate the signiﬁcance of this interaction. A real-time visualisation of the bowed strings complements the audio-haptic display.","author":[{"family":"Onofrei","given":"Marius-George"},{"family":"Fontana","given":"Federico"},{"family":"Willemsen","given":"Silvin"},{"family":"Seraﬁn","given":"Stefania"}],"citation-key":"onofreiBowingVirtualStrings2022","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Bowing virtual strings with realistic haptic feedback","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"onofreiPerceptualRelevanceHaptic2023","abstract":"The physics-based design and realization of a digital musical interface asks for the modeling and implementation of the contact-point interaction with the performer. Musical instruments always include a resonator that converts the input energy into sound, meanwhile feeding part of it back to the performer through the same point. Speciﬁcally during plucking or bowing interactions, musicians receive a handful of information from the force feedback and vibrations coming from the contact points. This paper focuses on the design and realization of digital music interfaces realizing two physical interactions along with a musically unconventional one, rubbing, rarely encountered in assimilable forms across the centuries on a few instruments. Therefore, it aims to highlight the signiﬁcance of haptic rendering in improving quality during a musical experience as opposed to interfaces provided with a passive contact point. Current challenges are posed by the speciﬁc requirements of the haptic device, as well as the computational effort needed for realizing such interactions without occurrence during the performance of typical digital artifacts such as latency and model instability. Both are however seemingly transitory due to the constant evolution of computer systems for virtual reality and the progressive popularization of haptic interfaces in the sonic interaction design community. In summary, our results speak in favor of adopting nowadays haptic technologies as an essential component for digital musical interfaces affording point-wise contact interactions in the personal performance space.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Onofrei","given":"Marius George"},{"family":"Fontana","given":"Federico"},{"family":"Serafin","given":"Stefania"}],"citation-key":"onofreiPerceptualRelevanceHaptic2023","container-title":"Arts","container-title-short":"Arts","DOI":"10.3390/arts12040144","ISSN":"2076-0752","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,7]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"144","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Perceptual Relevance of Haptic Feedback during Virtual Plucking, Bowing and Rubbing of Physically-Based Musical Resonators","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0752/12/4/144","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"oreganSensorimotorAccountVision2001a","abstract":"Many current neurophysiological, psychophysical, and psychological approaches to vision rest on the idea that when we see, the brain produces an internal representation of the world. The activation of this internal representation is assumed to give rise to the experience of seeing. The problem with this kind of approach is that it leaves unexplained how the existence of such a detailed internal representation might produce visual consciousness. An alternative proposal is made here. We propose that seeing is a way of acting. It is a particular way of exploring the environment. Activity in internal representations does not generate the experience of seeing. The outside world serves as its own, external, representation. The experience of seeing occurs when the organism masters what we call the governing laws of sensorimotor contingency. The advantage of this approach is that it provides a natural and principled way of accounting for visual consciousness, and for the differences in the perceived quality of sensory experience in the different sensory modalities. Several lines of empirical evidence are brought forward in support of the theory, in particular: evidence from experiments in sensorimotor adaptation, visual “filling in,” visual stability despite eye movements, change blindness, sensory substitution, and color perception.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,20]]},"author":[{"family":"O'Regan","given":"J.

In den Musik-, Medien- und Theaterwissenschaften ist kaum bekannt, dass die wohl ersten Arbeiten mit Sensortechnologie und dem damals frischgetauften MIDI-Protokoll in Amsterdam stattgefunden haben, wo Michel Waisvisz bereits 1984 mit dem Musiktheater-Projekt 'Touch Monkeys' sein Sensor-Interface 'The Hands' vorstellte. Neben Michel Waisvisz setzen u. a. Jon Rose, Nicolas Collins, Laetitia Sonami oder Stelarc das Gerät für ihre Arbeit ein. Der Artikel stellt einige Konﬁgurationen exemplarisch vor.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Otto","given":"Andi"}],"citation-key":"ottoSTEIMGeschichtenKurzschluesseZwischen2012","contributor":[{"literal":"Mediarep.Org"}],"DOI":"10.25969/MEDIAREP/22161","ISSN":"2191-0901","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"language":"de","publisher":"Hochschule für Musik und Theater Leipzig","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"STEIM-Geschichten.

Over the course of two years, Murakami and Ozawa discuss everything from Brahms to Beethoven, from Leonard Bernstein to Glenn Gould, from Bartok to Mahler, and from popup orchestras to opera. They listen to and dissect recordings of some of their favorite performances, and Murakami questions Ozawa about his career conducting orchestras around the world. Culminating in Murakami's ten-day visit to the banks of Lake Geneva to observe Ozawa's retreat for young musicians, the book is interspersed with ruminations on record collecting, jazz clubs, orchestra halls, film scores, and much more.

As a performer-scholar, who also writes non-performancerelated scholarship, I welcome this challenge, share some of Croft’s reservations about the ways in which these conceptions often manifest themselves, and also have concerns about the rushed integration of practitioners into academia and the implications for more traditional forms of scholarship. However, I find many of Croft’s formulations and assumptions too narrow, and instead argue that a good deal of the process of composition and performance does constitute research – grappling with difficult questions, exploring solutions, and producing creative work which embodies these solutions and from which others can draw much of value.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Pace","given":"Ian"}],"citation-key":"paceCompositionPerformanceCan2016","container-title":"Tempo","container-title-short":"Tempo","DOI":"10.1017/S0040298215000637","ISSN":"0040-2982, 1478-2286","issue":"275","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",1]]},"language":"en","license":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms","page":"60-70","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Composition and performance can be, and often have been, research","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0040298215000637/type/journal_article","volume":"70"},

  {"id":"pacioliDivinaProporcion1509","abstract":"Terminado en diciembre de 1497 e impreso en Venecia en 1509, La divina proporción es una de las obras más representativas del ambiente científico y artístico de la Italia de finales del siglo XV, y constituye el punto de partida de los numerosos trabajos dedicados a las proporciones del cuerpo humano y la arquitectura que serían escritos en los siglos siguientes. La proporción matemática resultante de la división de un segmento en media y extrema razón es asumida en el tratado como principio universal y objetivo de belleza. Las innumerables correspondencias que dicha proporción guarda con las propiedades de la divinidad justifican el calificativo de «divina». Esta obra responde, en líneas generales, a la visión estética y filosófica del neoplatonismo de la época, que concebía la imagen del universo como una construcción armónica en la que el hombre y el arte vendrían a ser reflejos de un orden cósmico superior.

  {"id":"paquetteMusicalEmotionalBursts2013","abstract":"The Musical Emotional Bursts (MEB) consist of 80 brief musical executions expressing basic emotional states (happiness, sadness and fear) and neutrality. These musical bursts were designed to be the musical analog of the Montreal Affective Voices (MAV)—a set of brief non-verbal affective vocalizations portraying different basic emotions. The MEB consist of short (mean duration: 1.6 s) improvisations on a given emotion or of imitations of a given MAV stimulus, played on a violin (10 stimuli × 4 [3 emotions + neutral]), or a clarinet (10 stimuli × 4 [3 emotions + neutral]). The MEB arguably represent a primitive form of music emotional expression, just like the MAV represent a primitive form of vocal, non-linguistic emotional expression. To create the MEB, stimuli were recorded from 10 violinists and 10 clarinetists, and then evaluated by 60 participants. Participants evaluated 240 stimuli [30 stimuli × 4 (3 emotions + neutral) × 2 instruments] by performing either a forced-choice emotion categorization task, a valence rating task or an arousal rating task (20 subjects per task); 40 MAVs were also used in the same session with similar task instructions. Recognition accuracy of emotional categories expressed by the MEB (n:80) was lower than for the MAVs but still very high with an average percent correct recognition score of 80.4%. Highest recognition accuracies were obtained for happy clarinet (92.0%) and fearful or sad violin (88.0% each) MEB stimuli. The MEB can be used to compare the cerebral processing of emotional expressions in music and vocal communication, or used for testing affective perception in patients with communication problems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Paquette","given":"Sébastien"},{"family":"Peretz","given":"Isabelle"},{"family":"Belin","given":"Pascal"}],"citation-key":"paquetteMusicalEmotionalBursts2013","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front.

  {"id":"parenteOrganoArtefactoAcerca2010","abstract":"El presente volumen <i>Del órgano al artefacto. Acerca de la dimensión biocultural de la técnica</i>, de Diego Parente, aborda una temática todavía novedosa en nuestro medio. Se trata del resultado de una cuidadosa investigación doctoral realizada en la Universidad de Buenos Aires, trabajo que por su naturaleza representa un valioso aporte, tanto a la reflexión filosófica como a los posibles cruces interdisciplinarios. El autor parte de una firme intuición pragmatista ligada a una concepción de la filosofía según la cual esta evolucionaría de acuerdo a dos series. Una, la más visible para los filósofos involucrados en la tarea, tiene que ver con factores internos de desenvolvimiento, la búsqueda de sistematicidad, alcance, coherencia, etc. La otra, que se hace visible principalmente en los momentos de crisis, da cuenta del desacompasamiento relativo por el cual los marcos conceptuales o «vocabularios » filosóficos se revelan más o menos adecuados para enfrentar las transformaciones ocurridas en la serie de lo socio-histórico. Con esta intuición rectora, de la que hay que decir que tal vez en ninguna parte resulte más plausible que en relación al dominio de la técnica y la tecnología, el autor examina las concepciones dominantes en el campo disciplinar de la filosofía de la tecnología: las concepciones protésica, instrumentalista y sustantiva. Frente a ellas, Parente encuentra que están en crisis no por cuestiones relativas a su coherencia interna, sino por su compromiso con una serie de supuestos (acerca de la técnica como instrumento moralmente neutro, heterónomo y por ello a disposición del usuario) que han sido puestos en cuestión en la actualidad por el desarrollo mismo de la realidad tecnológica. De cara a las limitaciones y a los aportes de las perspectivas analizadas, el autor se propone examinar la viabilidad de una interpretación biocultural de la tecnología.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Parente","given":"Diego"}],"citation-key":"parenteOrganoArtefactoAcerca2010","DOI":"10.35537/10915/26681","ISBN":"978-950-34-0680-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"language":"gl","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/ar/","publisher":"Editorial de la Universidad Nacional de La Plata (EDULP)","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Del órgano al artefacto: Acerca de la dimensión biocultural de la técnica","title-short":"Del órgano al artefacto","type":"book","URL":"http://sedici.unlp.edu.ar/handle/10915/26681"},

The Timbre Toolbox provides a comprehensive set of descriptors that can be useful in perceptual research, as well as in music information retrieval and machine-learning approaches to content-based retrieval in large sound databases. Sound events are first analyzed in terms of various input representations (short-term Fourier transform, harmonic sinusoidal components, an auditory model based on the equivalent rectangular bandwidth concept, the energy envelope). A large number of audio descriptors are then derived from each of these representations to capture temporal, spectral, spectrotemporal, and energetic properties of the sound events. Some descriptors are global, providing a single value for the whole sound event, whereas others are time-varying. Robust descriptive statistics are used to characterize the time-varying descriptors. To examine the information redundancy across audio descriptors, correlational analysis followed by hierarchical clustering is performed. This analysis suggests ten classes of relatively independent audio descriptors, showing that the Timbre Toolbox is a multidimensional instrument for the measurement of the acoustical structure of complex sound signals.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Peeters","given":"Geoffroy"},{"family":"Giordano","given":"Bruno L."},{"family":"Susini","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Misdariis","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"McAdams","given":"Stephen"}],"citation-key":"peetersTimbreToolboxExtracting2011","container-title":"The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America","DOI":"10.1121/1.3642604","ISSN":"0001-4966, 1520-8524","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"2902-2916","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Timbre Toolbox: Extracting audio descriptors from musical signals","title-short":"The Timbre Toolbox","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubs.aip.org/jasa/article/130/5/2902/842365/The-Timbre-Toolbox-Extracting-audio-descriptors","volume":"130"},

To perform music with the physical models, virtual musicians interpret the musical score and generate actions which control the physical models. The resulting audio and haptic signals are examined with support vector machines, which adjust the bowing parameters in order to establish and maintain a desirable timbre. This intelligent feedback control is trained with human input, but after the initial training is completed, the virtual musicians perform autonomously. The system can synthesize and control diﬀerent instruments of the same type (e.g., multiple distinct violins) and has been tested on two distinct string quartets (total of 8 violins, 2 violas, 2 cellos). In addition to audio, the system creates a video animation of the instruments performing the sheet music.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Percival","given":"Graham"},{"family":"Bailey","given":"Nicholas"},{"family":"Tzanetakis","given":"George"}],"citation-key":"percivalPhysicalModellingSupervised2013","container-title":"Proceedings of the 21st ACM international conference on Multimedia","DOI":"10.1145/2502081.2502101","event-place":"Barcelona Spain","event-title":"MM '13: ACM Multimedia Conference","ISBN":"978-1-4503-2404-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",10,21]]},"language":"en","page":"103-112","publisher":"ACM","publisher-place":"Barcelona Spain","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Physical modelling and supervised training of a virtual string quartet","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2502081.2502101"},

A set of approaches are emerging each representing different applications of the terminology as well as different inherent assumptions on the role of the user, designer and interaction ideals. In this paper, we use the concept of Pragmatist Aesthetics to provide a framework for distinguishing between different approaches to aesthetics. Moreover, we use our own design cases to illustrate how pragmatist aesthetics is a promising path to follow in the context of designing interactive systems, as it promotes aesthetics of use, rather than aesthetics of appearance. We coin this approach in the perspective of aesthetic interaction. Finally we make the point that aesthetics is not re-defining everything known about interactive systems.

I propose an ontology of decentered becoming that can help us take seriously the multiplicity of ‘found’ ontologies. A key concept is that of ‘islands of stability’, which enables a comparative transition between the worlds of science and shamanism. This offers an opportunity to reflect back critically and politically on modernity, while highlighting the problems of anthropological translation that surface in a performative apprehension of non-modern worlds. In conclusion, I touch on scientific and nonscientific worlds (complexity theory, cybernetics, Taoism, Zen) that do not center themselves on islands of stability.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Pickering","given":"Andrew"}],"citation-key":"pickeringOntologicalTurnTaking2017","container-title":"Social Analysis","DOI":"10.3167/sa.2017.610209","ISSN":"0155-977X, 1558-5727","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",1,1]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Ontological Turn: Taking Different Worlds Seriously","title-short":"The Ontological Turn","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://berghahnjournals.com/view/journals/social-analysis/61/2/sa610209.xml","volume":"61"},

  {"id":"piekutTomorrowQuestionNew2014","abstract":"In recent decades, experimental music has flourished outside of European and American concert halls. The principles of indeterminacy, improvisation, nonmusical sound, and noise, pioneered in concert and on paper by the likes of Henry Cowell, John Cage, and Ornette Coleman, can now be found in a variety of new locations: activist films, rock recordings, and public radio broadcasts, not to mention in avant-garde movements around the world. The contributors to Tomorrow Is the Question explore these previously unexamined corners of experimental music history, considering topics such as Sonic Youth, Julius Eastman, the Downtown New York pop avant-garde of the 1970s, Fluxus composer Benjamin Patterson, Tokyo's Music group (aka Group Ongaku), the Balinese avant-garde, the Leicester school of British experimentalists, Cuba's Grupo de Experimentación Sonora del ICAIC, Pauline Oliveros's score for the feminist documentary Maquilapolis, NPR's 1980s RadioVisions, and the philosophy of experimental musical aesthetics. Taken together, this menagerie of people, places, and things makes up an experimentalism that is always partial, compromised, and invented in its local and particular formations--in other words, these individual cases suggest that experimentalism has been a far more variegated set of practices and discourses than previously recognized. Asking new questions leads to researching new materials, individuals, and contexts and, eventually, to the new critical paradigms that are necessary to interpret these new materials. Tomorrow Is the Question, gathering contributions from historical musicology, ethnomusicology, history, philosophy, and cultural studies, generates future research directions in experimental music studies by way of a productive inquiry that sustains and elaborates critical conversations","author":[{"family":"Piekut","given":"Benjamin"}],"citation-key":"piekutTomorrowQuestionNew2014","event-place":"Ann Arbor, Mich","ISBN":"978-0-472-11926-4 978-0-472-12011-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"University of Michigan press","publisher-place":"Ann Arbor, Mich","source":"BnF ISBN","title":"Tomorrow is the question: new directions in experimental music studies","title-short":"Tomorrow is the question","type":"book"},

  {"id":"pignaVozGranJefe2015","abstract":"José de San Martín es uno de los hombres más nombrados y más homenajeados de nuestro país y a la vez, paradójicamente, uno de los menos conocidos en toda su dimensión. Las miles de calles (una por pueblo o ciudad) que llevan su nombre, las centenares de plazas, los tantos y tantos monumentos y bustos poco nos dicen de este hombre que lo dio todo por su país, que se comprometió hasta sus últimos momentos con la suerte de sus habitantes. Extraordinario estratega militar, que se inició en la carrera de las armas a los once años y a los quince ya era un oficial con mando de tropa; enorme lector y fundador de bibliotecas, pintor y concertista de guitarra. Calumniado hasta el extremo, perseguido, ninguneado y exiliado, su aguda mirada del país fue acallada, sus opiniones políticas ocultadas; su visión del ejército y el rol de las fuerzas armadas en la sociedad civil, censurada”. Con la minuciosa investigación y el estilo atrapante que lo han convertido en uno de los historiadores latinoamericanos más leídos, en esta nueva obra Felipe Pigna encara la biografía del prócer máximo de la Argentina. La voz del Gran Jefe desentraña los mitos y debates que en vida y en la posterior construcción de su imagen como “Padre de la Patria” han rodeado a la figura de José de San Martín, para mostrarnos al hombre público y privado en todas sus dimensiones. Entre otros aspectos clave, pasa por una revisión crítica las versiones sobre su posible origen mestizo, su rigurosa formación intelectual y militar, sus complejas relaciones familiares, sus vinculaciones con la francmasonería y la diplomacia británica, sus adhesiones ideológicas y proyectos políticos, en su admirable trayectoria de libertador de América, los cuestionados motivos de su renuncia y su extraño ostracismo final. También incluye extensos párrafos del libelo inédito atribuido al general Carlos María de Alvear titulado Primera parte de la vida del general José de San Martín, una curiosa pieza bibliográfica que se ocultó a la lectura de los argentinos por casi doscientos años. El monumental trabajo de Felipe Pigna devela un San Martín integral, que permite comprender su extraordinaria actuación en la fundación de las naciones latinoamericanas y la grandeza que inspiró cada uno de sus pasos.","author":[{"family":"Pigna","given":"Felipe"}],"citation-key":"pignaVozGranJefe2015","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",8,28]]},"language":"es","note":"Item ID: _:n2","publisher":"ePubLibre","title":"La voz del Gran Jefe","type":"book"},
  {"id":"pigremWeSpeakSensor2018","abstract":"This paper explores the role of materiality in Digital Musical Instruments and questions the inﬂuence of tacit understandings of sensor technology. Existing research investigates the use of gesture, physical interaction and subsequent parameter mapping. We suggest that a tacit knowledge of the ‘sensor layer’ brings with it deﬁnitions, understandings and expectations that forge and guide our approach to interaction. We argue that the inﬂuence of technology starts before a sound is made, and comes from not only intuition of material properties, but also received notions of what technology can and should do. On encountering an instrument with obvious sensors, a potential performer will attempt to predict what the sensors do and what the designer intends for them to do, becoming inﬂuenced by a machine centered understanding of interaction and not a solely material centred one. The paper presents an observational study of interaction using non-functional prototype instruments designed to explore fundamental ideas and understandings of instrumental interaction in the digital realm. We will show that this understanding inﬂuences both gestural language and ability to characterise an expected sonic/musical response.","author":[{"family":"Pigrem","given":"Jon"},{"family":"McPherson","given":"Andrew"}],"citation-key":"pigremWeSpeakSensor2018","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Do We Speak Sensor?

  {"id":"piilonenTheorizingMusicEvolution2024","abstract":"Abstract\n            Theorizing Music Evolution is a critical examination of ideas about musical origins, emphasizing nineteenth-century theories of music in the evolutionist writings of Charles Darwin and Herbert Spencer. What did Darwin and Spencer have to say about music? What role did music play in their evolutionary theories? What were the values and limits of these evolutionist turns of thought, and in what ways have they endured in present-day music research? The book argues for the significance of Victorian music-evolutionism in light of its ties to a recently revitalized subfield of evolutionary musicology. Taking an interdisciplinary approach to music theorizing, Piilonen explores how historical thinkers constructed music in evolutionist terms and argues for an updated understanding of music as an especially fraught area of evolutionary thought. Historical evolutionists such as Darwin and Spencer developed and applied a concept of music that served as a boundary-drawing device, used to trace or obscure the conceptual borders between human and animal. For Darwin, music served as a kind of proto-language common to humans and animals alike. Spencer viewed music as a specifically human stage of evolutionary advance, beyond language acquisition. These competing views established radically different perspectives on the origin and function of music in human cultural expression, while at the same time being mutually constitutive of one another. A groundbreaking contribution to music theory and histories of science, Theorizing Music Evolution turns to the idea of music evolution with an eye toward disrupting and intervening in these questions as they recur in the present.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Piilonen","given":"Miriam"}],"citation-key":"piilonenTheorizingMusicEvolution2024","DOI":"10.1093/oso/9780197695289.001.0001","edition":"1","ISBN":"978-0-19-769528-9 978-0-19-769531-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,16]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Oxford University PressNew York","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Theorizing Music Evolution: Darwin, Spencer, and the Limits of the Human","title-short":"Theorizing Music Evolution","type":"book","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/book/55759"},

  {"id":"pinchSocialConstructionFacts1984","abstract":"The need for an integrated social constructivist approach towards the study of science and technology is outlined. Within such a programme both scientific facts and technological artefacts are to be understood as social constructs. Literature on the sociology of science, the science-technology relationship, and technology studies is reviewed. The empirical programme of relativism within the sociology of scientific knowledge and a recent study of the social construction of technological artefacts are combined to produce the new approach. The concepts of `interpretative flexibility' and `closure mechanism', and the notion of `social group' are developed and illustrated by reference to a study of solar physics and a study of the development of the bicycle. The paper concludes by setting out some of the terrain to be explored in future studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Pinch","given":"Trevor J."},{"family":"Bijker","given":"Wiebe E."}],"citation-key":"pinchSocialConstructionFacts1984","container-title":"Social Studies of Science","container-title-short":"Soc Stud Sci","DOI":"10.1177/030631284014003004","ISSN":"0306-3127, 1460-3659","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1984",8]]},"language":"en","license":"http://journals.sagepub.com/page/policies/text-and-data-mining-license","page":"399-441","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Social Construction of Facts and Artefacts: or How the Sociology of Science and the Sociology of Technology might Benefit Each Other","title-short":"The Social Construction of Facts and Artefacts","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/030631284014003004","volume":"14"},

  {"id":"pinkerEnlightenmentNowCase2018","abstract":"Is the world really falling apart? Is the ideal of progress obsolete? Cognitive scientist Steven Pinker urges us to step back from the gory headlines and prophecies of doom, which play to our psychological biases. Instead, follow the data. In seventy-five graphs, Pinker shows that life, health, prosperity, safety, peace, knowledge, and happiness are on the rise, not just in the West, but worldwide. This progress is not the result of some cosmic force. It is a gift of the Enlightenment: the conviction that reason and science can enhance human flourishing. Far from being a naïve hope, the Enlightenment, we now know, has worked. But more than ever, it needs a vigorous defense. The Enlightenment project swims against currents of human nature -- tribalism, authoritarianism, demonization, magical thinking -- which demagogues are all too willing to exploit. Many commentators, committed to political, religious, or romantic ideologies, fight a rearguard action against it. The result is a corrosive fatalism and a willingness to wreck the precious institutions of liberal democracy and global cooperation.

Gracias a esto, al contrario que en la mayoría de los diálogos, Sócrates no aparece aquí. Esto es porque el diálogo tiene lugar en Creta, y Sócrates nunca aparece fuera de Atenas en los escritos de Platón. En lugar de Sócrates, tenemos como protagonistas a un anciano ateniense (contrafigura del propio Platón) y otros dos ancianos: un espartano (Megilo) y un cretense (Clinias) de Cnosos. El ateniense se une a los otros dos en su peregrinaje religioso al santuario de Zeus. El diálogo completo tiene lugar durante esa jornada, emulando la acción de Minos, al cual atribuyen los cretenses la redacción de sus antiguas leyes y que hacía este camino cada nueve años para recibir instrucciones de Zeus. Hacia el final del tercer capítulo, Clinias anuncia que tiene el encargo de establecer las leyes de una nueva colonia cretense y que agradecería la ayuda del ateniense.

A summary of the argument is that by creating a multi-dimensional environment of Sonic Vector Spaces (see page 17) and implementing a method for quickly traversing that environment, a performer is able to create enough information flow to achieve laptop virtuosity. At the same time, traversing this multi-dimensional environment produces a perceptible sonic language that can add structural signposts for the listener to latch on to in performance. Specifics of the author's personal approach to this problem, a software environment coded in SuperCollider, are then shared.

Depending on model complexity, it may be able to reproduce various subtle phenomena related to excitation and real time control of an instrument, providing an intuitive tool for a musician. A variant of physical modelling synthesis, referred to as the simulation of infeasible instruments, uses a model of an object that does not have a physical counterpart. Such model has some properties of a real object, which makes it still intuitive for a musician. However, other features, such as geometry, or material properties, are intentionally altered in such manner, that it could not function in reality. These infeasible features introduce new properties to the sound it produces.

In this discussion, the term ‘gesture’ indicates a movement of the body consciously performed and able to express or communicate something. The expression ‘cognitively plausible’ refers to an interactive sound response that is immediate, continuously varying and enactively3 coherent with the generating (sonified) gesture.\nOBJECTIVES: The objectives of this paper are two. The first is an artistic exploration of gesture sonifications4 in various contexts. The second is rather methodological, i.e., to provide a possible general paradigm for Artistic Research5 (AR).\nMETHODS: More in detail, the AR phenomenological approach is modeled according to an Interaction Design (IxD) research paradigm.\nRESULTS: A number of case studies of gesture sonification are presented and discussed according to the above methodological framework.\nCONCLUSION: We claim that the introduction of such methodological framework was successful in terms of providing robust guidelines for our research and for a clear and structured presentation of its results.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Polotti","given":"P."},{"family":"Goina","given":"M."}],"citation-key":"polottiGestureSonificationInteraction2021","container-title":"EAI Endorsed Transactions on Creative Technologies","container-title-short":"EAI Endorsed Transactions on Creative Technologies","DOI":"10.4108/eai.19-3-2021.169036","ISSN":"2409-9708","issue":"27","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,12]]},"language":"en","page":"169036","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Gesture Sonification.

  {"id":"pourghaderBioinspiredFlowSensingCapacitive2024","abstract":"Inspired by the auditory systems of small animals such as spiders, the tachinid fly, Ormia ochracea, and mosquitoes, a novel low-noise, flow-sensing capacitive MEMS microphone capable of sensing acoustic particle velocity is introduced. Unlike virtually all conventional microphones that have a diaphragm for sensing sound pressure, this design consists of a thin, porous, movable structure that is intended to be driven by viscous forces due to the sound-induced flow. This viscous force then rotates the movable structure around a middle central hinge and creates a change in capacitance due to a relative motion between neighboring beams on the movable and fixed electrodes which creates an electronic signal through a charge amplifier circuit. The whole structure is made of one layer of silicon using a Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) wafer using photolithography technology consisting of moving and fixed electrodes with a thickness of 5µm. The movable part has dimensions of 0.7mm×1.2mm and is placed above a cavity inside the bulk silicon that facilitates the flow of sound particles. Because this microphone responds to flow (a vector) rather than pressure (a scalar), this design has an output that depends on the sound propagation direction and can cancel out sound from unwanted directions. Experimental results show that it has very promising capabilities for achieving the next generation of MEMS microphones that respond to acoustic flow rather than pressure and can be integrated with other sound sensors for consumer electronics and hearing aids.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Pourghader","given":"Johar"},{"family":"Cui","given":"Weili"},{"family":"Lai","given":"Junpeng"},{"family":"Farahikia","given":"Mahdi"},{"family":"Ke","given":"Changhong"},{"family":"Karimi","given":"Morteza"},{"family":"Miles","given":"Ronald N"}],"citation-key":"pourghaderBioinspiredFlowSensingCapacitive2024","DOI":"10.36227/techrxiv.170595888.89023812/v1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,22]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","publisher":"Preprints","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Bio-inspired Flow-Sensing Capacitive MEMS Microphone","type":"article","URL":"https://www.techrxiv.org/users/652408/articles/700728-bio-inspired-flow-sensing-capacitive-mems-microphone?commit=abc74b01f5811b0b84c39c9cb7d31cc52b26d730"},

However, the problem of explainability cannot be exhaustively solved in the abstract, as there is no single approach that can be universally applied to generate adequate explanations for any given AI system, and this is especially true in the arts. In this position paper, we propose an Explanatory Pragmatism (EP) framework for XAI in music performance, emphasising the importance of context and audience in the development of explainability requirements. By tailoring explanations to specific audiences and continuously refining them based on feedback, EP offers a promising direction for enhancing the transparency and interpretability of AI systems in broad artistic applications and more specifically to music performance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Privato","given":"Nicola"},{"family":"Armitage","given":"Jack"}],"citation-key":"privatoContextSensitiveApproachXAI2023","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2309.04491","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,5]]},"language":"en","number":"arXiv:2309.04491","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"A Context-Sensitive Approach to XAI in Music Performance","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04491"},

  {"id":"Ranciere2008","abstract":"“Aquel que ve no sabe ver”: esta presuposición atraviesa nuestra historia, de la caverna platónica a la denuncia de la sociedad del espectáculo. Es común al filósofo que quiere que cada uno ocupe su lugar y a los revolucionarios que quieren arrancar a los dominados de las ilusiones que los mantienen en ese estado. Algunos emplean explicaciones sutiles o instalaciones espectaculares para mostrar a los ciegos lo que estos no ven. Otros quieren cortar el mal de raíz, transformando el espectáculo en acción y al espectador en hombre que actúa. Los estudios reunidos aquí oponen a esas dos estrategias una hipótesis simple: el hecho de ver no implica ninguna debilidad; la transformación en espectadores de quienes estaban destinados a las coacciones y a las jerarquías de la acción pudo contribuir a conmover las posiciones sociales, y la denuncia del hombre alienado por el exceso de imágenes fue de entrada la respuesta del orden dominante a ese desorden. La emancipación del espectador es entonces la afirmación de su capacidad de ver lo que él ve y de saber qué pensar y qué hacer con ello. Al examinar algunas formas y debates del arte contemporáneo, este libro intenta responder a las preguntas: ¿qué entender por arte político o política del arte? ¿Cómo nos situamos respecto a la tradición del arte crítico y del deseo de incluir el arte en la vida? ¿Cómo la crítica militante de la mercancía y de la imagen devino la afirmación melancólica de su omnipotencia o la denuncia reaccionaria del “hombre democrático”?","author":[{"family":"Rancière","given":"Jacques"}],"citation-key":"Ranciere2008","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"publisher":"Ediciones Manantial","title":"El espectador emancipado","type":"book"},

  {"id":"ranciereFabulaCinematografica2001","abstract":"Una niña y su asesino frente a un escaparate, una silueta negra descendiendo las escaleras, la falda arrancada de una campesina soviética, una mujer que corre ante las balas: estas imágenes -firmadas por Lang, Murnau, Eisenstein o Rossellini- singularizan el cine y esconden sus paradojas. Un arte es siempre, al mismo tiempo, una idea y un sueño del arte. La identidad entre voluntad artística y mirada impasible ya había sido concebida por la filosofía y ensayada, a su modo, por la novela y el teatro. El cine viene a colmar esa espera, a costa, sin embargo, de contradecirla. En los años veinte fue considerado como un nuevo lenguaje de las ideas, finalmente sensibles, que abolía el viejo arte de las historias y los personajes. Pero también iba a restaurar las intrigas, los tipos y los géneros que la literatura y la pintura habían hecho saltar por los aires. Jacques Rancière analiza las formas de ese conflicto entre dos poéticas que es el alma del cine. Entre el sueño de Jean Epstein y la enciclopedia desencantada de Jean-Luc Godard, entre el adiós al teatro y el encuentro con la televisión, adentrándose en el Oeste tras el rastro de James Stewart o en el país de los conceptos en pos de Gilles Deleuze, el autor muestra cómo la fábula cinematográfica es siempre una fábula contrariada. Por eso disuelve las fronteras entre el documento y la ficción. Sueño del siglo XIX, esa fábula nos explica la historia del siglo XX.","author":[{"family":"Rancière","given":"Jacques"}],"citation-key":"ranciereFabulaCinematografica2001","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001",1,1]]},"language":"es","note":"Item ID: _:n36","publisher":"ePubLibre","title":"La fábula cinematográfica","type":"book"},

  {"id":"razMethodsIdentifyingEmergent2023","abstract":"The present perspective discusses methods to detect concepts in internal representations (hidden layers) of deep neural networks (DNNs), such as network dissection, feature visualization, and testing with concept activation vectors (TCAV). I argue that these methods provide evidence that DNNs are able to learn non-trivial relations between concepts. However, the methods also require users to specify or detect concepts via (sets of) instances. This underdetermines the meaning of concepts, making the methods unreliable. The problem could be overcome, to some extent, by systematically combining the methods and by using synthetic datasets. The perspective also discusses how conceptual spaces—sets of concepts in internal representations—are shaped by a trade-off between predictive accuracy and compression. I argue that conceptual spaces are useful, or even necessary, to understand how concepts are formed in DNNs but that there is a lack of method for studying conceptual spaces.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Räz","given":"Tim"}],"citation-key":"razMethodsIdentifyingEmergent2023","container-title":"Patterns","container-title-short":"Patterns","DOI":"10.1016/j.patter.2023.100761","ISSN":"26663899","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",6]]},"language":"en","page":"100761","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Methods for identifying emergent concepts in deep neural networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S266638992300106X","volume":"4"},

The Derridean theme of the historial movement of a trace is connected to Prigogine's notion of an operator-time. It is suggested that both conceptions can be used to characterize the dynamics of experimental systems in contemporary science. It is argued that such systems have, to speak with Hacking, “a life of their own” and that this is precisely the reason for their inherent unpredictability.\n            In the second part, a case from the history of virology and cytomorphology is presented. The movement of a particular experimental system is followed in its peculiar tension between deferring and becoming different—i.e., between the persistence of a problem and the vagaries of its successive transformations. They are rendered possible by novel technical implementations, but they are not determined in any meaningful sense on a mere technological level.\n            In conclusion, a point is made for a deconstructive approach to the history of science.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Reinberger","given":"Hans-Jörg"}],"citation-key":"reinbergerExperimentalSystemsHistoriality1994","container-title":"Science in Context","container-title-short":"Science in Context","DOI":"10.1017/S0269889700001599","ISSN":"0269-8897, 1474-0664","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1994"]]},"language":"en","license":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms","page":"65-81","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Experimental Systems: Historiality, Narration, and Deconstruction","title-short":"Experimental Systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0269889700001599/type/journal_article","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"reymoreTimbreSemanticAssociations2023","abstract":"The main objective of this study is to understand how timbre semantic associations—for example, a sound’s timbre perceived as bright, rough, or hollow—vary with register and pitch height across instruments. In this experiment, 540 online participants rated single, sustained notes from eight Western orchestral instruments (flute, oboe, bass clarinet, trumpet, trombone, violin, cello, and vibraphone) across three registers (low, medium, and high) on 20 semantic scales derived from Reymore and Huron (2020). The 24 two-second stimuli, equalized in loudness, were produced using the Vienna Symphonic Library.\n            Exploratory modeling examined relationships between mean ratings of each semantic dimension and instrument, register, and participant musician identity (“musician” vs. “nonmusician”). For most semantic descriptors, both register and instrument were significant predictors, though the amount of variance explained differed (marginal R2). Terms that had the strongest positive relationships with register include shrill/harsh/noisy, sparkling/brilliant/bright, ringing/long decay, and percussive. Terms with the strongest negative relationships with register include deep/thick/heavy, raspy/grainy/gravelly, hollow, and woody. Post hoc modeling using only pitch height and only register to predict mean semantic rating suggests that pitch height may explain more variance than does register. Results help clarify the influence of both instrument and relative register (and pitch height) on common timbre semantic associations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Reymore","given":"Lindsey"},{"family":"Noble","given":"Jason"},{"family":"Saitis","given":"Charalampos"},{"family":"Traube","given":"Caroline"},{"family":"Wallmark","given":"Zachary"}],"citation-key":"reymoreTimbreSemanticAssociations2023","container-title":"Music Perception","DOI":"10.1525/mp.2023.40.3.253","ISSN":"0730-7829, 1533-8312","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"253-274","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Timbre Semantic Associations Vary Both Between and Within Instruments","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://online.ucpress.edu/mp/article/40/3/253/195233/Timbre-Semantic-Associations-Vary-Both-Between-and","volume":"40"},

In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations.

  {"id":"rhodesNewInterfacesApproaches2020","abstract":"Interactive music uses wearable sensors (i.e., gestural interfaces—GIs) and biometric datasets to reinvent traditional human–computer interaction and enhance music composition. In recent years, machine learning (ML) has been important for the artform. This is because ML helps process complex biometric datasets from GIs when predicting musical actions (termed performance gestures). ML allows musicians to create novel interactions with digital media. Wekinator is a popular ML software amongst artists, allowing users to train models through demonstration. It is built on the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) framework, which is used to build supervised predictive models. Previous research has used biometric data from GIs to train speciﬁc ML models. However, previous research does not inform optimum ML model choice, within music, or compare model performance. Wekinator offers several ML models. Thus, we used Wekinator and the Myo armband GI and study three performance gestures for piano practice to solve this problem. Using these, we trained all models in Wekinator and investigated their accuracy, how gesture representation affects model accuracy and if optimisation can arise. Results show that neural networks are the strongest continuous classiﬁers, mapping behaviour differs amongst continuous models, optimisation can occur and gesture representation disparately affects model mapping behaviour; impacting music practice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Rhodes","given":"Chris"},{"family":"Allmendinger","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Climent","given":"Ricardo"}],"citation-key":"rhodesNewInterfacesApproaches2020","container-title":"Entropy","container-title-short":"Entropy","DOI":"10.3390/e22121384","ISSN":"1099-4300","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,7]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"1384","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"New Interfaces and Approaches to Machine Learning When Classifying Gestures within Music","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/22/12/1384","volume":"22"},

Los que no pueden recordar el pasado están condenados a repetirlo . Esta célebre frase de George Santayana podría ilustrar una de las ideas más convencionales respecto a la memoria histórica. Actualmente existe el consenso explícito y casi absoluto de que lo moralmente correcto es recordar. ¿Por qué somos tan tajantes en cuestiones tan delicadas como esta? En esta candente y polémica obra el heterodoxo intelectual David Rieff revisita la cuestión de la memoria histórica y presenta un conmovedor alegato contra nuestra pasión por el pasado. Analizando varios de los conflictos más definitorios de la historia reciente -el conflicto de Irlanda del Norte, la Guerra Civil española, la Guerra de los Balcanes, el Holocausto y el 11S- Rieff concluye que la memoria colectiva no es tanto un imperativo moral como una opción. La memoria histórica puede ser tóxica y, a veces, lo correcto es olvidar. Brillante y contundente, este lúcido ensayo es un tratado de filosofía moral indispensable sobre los usos y abusos de la historia colectiva.

  {"id":"romeroBreveHistoriaArgentina1965","abstract":"Pensada como una obra destinada a «suscitar la reflexión sobre el presente y el futuro del país» esta Breve historia de la Argentina se ha convertido, con los años, en un libro clásico. Obra de síntesis, pero a la vez de ideas, en sus páginas no sólo se encuentran hechos sino también interpretaciones que generan polémicas y suscitan opiniones encontradas. Escrito en 1965, fue actualizado por el autor poco antes de su fallecimiento en 1977. Por la notable difusión que tuvo, tanto como por su extendido uso en la enseñanza, Luis Alberto Romero agregó un último capítulo, referido a los acontecimientos de las últimas décadas, «ciertamente decisivos para la comprensión de nuestro presente y de conocimiento fundamental para la formación de un ciudadano». Considerado, con justicia, como uno de los mayores intelectuales que ha dado el país, José Luis Romero no sólo renovó los estudios históricos; transmitió además sus ideas de un modo tan claro como atractivo. Ejemplo mayor de ello es este libro, cuyo estilo, sencillo y refinado, hace que la lectura de la historia sea a la vez aprendizaje y placer. El Fondo de Cultura Económica, que ya había editado numerosas obras del autor, dio inicio, con este libro, a la Biblioteca José Luis Romero, que se publicó en memoria suya a los veinte años de su fallecimiento. Esta nueva edición, preparada por Luis Alberto Romero, es la versión definitiva de una obra fundamental.","author":[{"family":"Romero","given":"José Luis"}],"citation-key":"romeroBreveHistoriaArgentina1965","issued":{"date-parts":[["1965",1,1]]},"language":"es","note":"Item ID: _:n6","publisher":"ePubLibre","title":"Breve historia de la Argentina","type":"book"},
  {"id":"romerocontrerasLogicaRealismoEspeculativo2023","abstract":"Since the beginning of the 20th century, philosophy discredited the legitimacy of realism, confining philosophical interrogation within the boundaries of our subjectivity. The limits and problems of this philosophical premise have finally been enunciated and underscored by speculative realism. In this article we show how three of its most prominent representatives, Meillassoux, Harman and Gabriel, undertake this task. Now, to avoid a naive position, this realism is speculatively articulated, that is, based on logical, mathematical and abstract arguments. But such an approach is not free of problems. After a brief exposition of their philosophies, we discuss central problems the exhibit, deriving from a lack of reflection on the logical and mathematical resources employed, explicitly or implicitly. We show that a common issue in all three authors is a lack of reflection both on the self-reference paradoxes that they put into play, and a complete lack of a general theory of real relations. Only such a theory could explain two fundamental relationships: subject-object and object-object. We conclude with a brief reference to Fréredic Nef to show some basic points that a general theory of relations should consider.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Romero Contreras","given":"Arturo"}],"citation-key":"romerocontrerasLogicaRealismoEspeculativo2023","container-title":"Revista Colombiana de Filosofía de la Ciencia","container-title-short":"Rev. colomb. filos. cienc.","DOI":"10.18270/rcfc.v23i46.3876","ISSN":"2463-1159, 0124-4620","issue":"46","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,30]]},"language":"es","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0","page":"41-83","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"lógica del realismo especulativo: relación entre objetos y autorreferencia","title-short":"lógica del realismo especulativo","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://revistas.unbosque.edu.co/index.php/rcfc/article/view/3876","volume":"23"},

Such a renovation brings the question of locality into new focus, given the localized character of all such struggles, where this is distributed at various scales from the cellular to the biospheric and technospheric. This paper pursues this question of locality in two parts: the first finds resources for such a renovation in Empedocles, and notes how these were repressed by Aristotle but resurrected by Sigmund Freud and Friedrich Nietzsche; the second stages a confrontation between Stiegler and Peter Sloterdijk, asking under what conditions the latter’s immunological spherology could be brought into Stiegler’s project, which we place under the umbrella of what we are proposing to call metacosmics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Ross","given":"Daniel"}],"citation-key":"rossEndMetaphysicsBeing2020","container-title":"Phainomena","DOI":"10.32022/PHI29.2020.112-113.4","ISSN":"2232-6650","issue":"112-113","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,15]]},"language":"en","page":"73-100","source":"DOI.org (CSL JSON)","title":"The End of the Metaphysics of Being and the Beginning of the Metacosmics of Entropy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.32022/PHI29.2020.112-113.4","volume":"29"},

Bio-sensors and bodily tracking technologies afford new ways for artists to engage with audiences, and for audiences to become part of the artwork.

This paper explores such issues by presenting five design ideas for interactive performance afforded by bio-sensing and bodily tracking technologies (i.e. Microsoft Kinect) developed during two design workshops.

  {"id":"rozendaalGivingFormSmart2018","abstract":"Artificial intelligence (AI) has recently been highlighted as a design material in the HCI community. This acknowledgement is a call for interaction designers to consider intelligence as a resource for design. While this view is valid and well-grounded, it brings with it a need to better understand how intelligence as a design material can be used in formgiving practices. This chapter seeks to address this need by suggesting a new approach that integrates AI in the designer’s toolkit. This approach considers intelligence as being part of, and expressed through, an object's character, hereby integrating artificial intelligence into a product's form. We describe and discuss this approach by presenting and reflecting on our experiences in a design course where students were asked to give form to intelligent everyday objects in three iterative design cycles. We discuss the implications of our approach and findings within the frame of third wave HCI.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Rozendaal","given":"Marco C."},{"family":"Ghajargar","given":"Maliheh"},{"family":"Pasman","given":"Gert"},{"family":"Wiberg","given":"Mikael"}],"citation-key":"rozendaalGivingFormSmart2018","container-title":"New Directions in Third Wave Human-Computer Interaction: Volume 1 - Technologies","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-319-73356-2_3","editor":[{"family":"Filimowicz","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Tzankova","given":"Veronika"}],"event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-319-73355-5 978-3-319-73356-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","page":"25-42","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Giving Form to Smart Objects: Exploring Intelligence as an Interaction Design Material","title-short":"Giving Form to Smart Objects","type":"chapter","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-73356-2_3"},

  {"id":"ryderAcousticalUnconsciousWalter2022","abstract":"Is there an acoustical equivalent to Walter Benjamin's idea of the optical unconscious? In the 1930s, Benjamin was interested in how visual media expand our optical perception: the invention of the camera allowed us to see images and details that we could not consciously perceive before. This study argues that Benjamin was also concerned with how acoustical media allow us to \"hear otherwise,\" that is, to listen to sound structures previously lost to the naked ear. Crucially, they help sensitize us to the discursive sonority of words, which Benjamin was already alluding to in his autobiographical work. In five chapters that range in scope from Tieck's Blonde Eckbert, which Benjamin once called his locus classicus of his theory of forgetting, to Alexander Kluge's films and short texts, where he develops what he calls \"sound perspectives,\" this monograph discusses how the acoustical unconscious enriches our understanding of different media, from the written word to radio and film.

  {"id":"sadinInteligenciaArtificialDesafio2021","abstract":"Sadin encara el concepto de \"inteligencia artificial\" a partir de la historia de las ideas y de una fenomenología de los aparatos para evaluar qué cambios radicales se están dando en el modo de construcción de lo real.La hipótesis de este libro es que la causa (y no la consecuencia) de la pregnancia del fenómeno de la inteligencia artificial es un cambio de estatuto de las tecnologías digitales: de ser prótesis acumulativas e intelectivas -porque permiten el almacenamiento, la indexación y el tráfico veloz de información-, han pasado a ser entidades de las que se espera que enuncien una verdad a partir de la interpretación automatizada de situaciones. Bajo un arco de formas que van de las más amables (sugerencias de compra, de movimientos) a las más coactivas (clasificación e indexación de los humanos para incluirlos/excluirlos de ciertos beneficios y derechos), en áreas relacionadas con la vida social general (la economía) o en otras que rozan la intimidad del individuo (la evaluación médica sobre su propio cuerpo), la inteligencia artificial propone diagnósticos que se suponen superiores a los humanos porque parten del manejo y correlación de datos imposibles de realizar por un individuo. Así, gracias a este poder de enunciar una verdad que los humanos no podemos ver, la tecnología deja de ser protésica para devenir antropomórfica. La autonomía de decisión de los sistemas de inteligencia artificial termina de cerrar el círculo de este cambio radical, enfrentándonos por primera vez con el estadio del tecno-logos de la técnica: no un logos sobre la técnica producido por los humanos sino humanos modelados por una técnica capaz de producir discurso o verdad.

The era of the mechanical reproduction of music has, rather ironically, opened up new perspectives, which have contributed to the revitalisation of the performer&#x2019;s role and the concept of music as performance. This book examines questions related to music that cannot be set in conventional notation, reporting and reflecting on current research and creative practice primarily in live electronic music. It studies compositions for which the musical text is problematic, that is, non-existent, incomplete, insufficiently precise or transmitted in a nontraditional format. Thus, at the core of this project is an absence. The objects of study lack a reliably precise graphical representation of the work as the composer or the composer/performer conceived or imagined it. How do we compose, perform and study music that cannot be set in conventional notation?

  {"id":"samitDisruptYou2015","abstract":"<p>In today's volatile business landscape, adaptability and creativity are more crucial than ever. It is no longer possible-or even desirable-to learn one set of job skills and to work your way up the ladder. At the same time, entrepreneurs with great ideas for new products or technologies that could change the world often struggle to capture the attention of venture capital firms and incubators; finding the funding necessary to launch a start-up can feel impossible. The business leaders of our future must anticipate change to create their own opportunities for personal satisfaction and professional success. In <i>Disrupt You!,</i> Jay Samit, a digital media expert who has launched, grown, and sold start-ups and Fortune 500 companies alike, describes the unique method he has used to invent new markets and expand established businesses. </p><p>Samit has been at the helm of businesses in the ecommerce, digital video, social media, mobile communications, and software industries,...","author":[{"family":"Samit","given":"Jay"}],"citation-key":"samitDisruptYou2015","ISBN":"978-1-250-05939-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"language":"en-US","license":"All rights reserved","note":"Item ID: _:n18","publisher":"Flatiron Books","title":"Disrupt You!","type":"book"},

Sapolsky analiza los factores en juego, desde el momento previo hasta los factores arraigados en la historia de nuestra especie y su legado evolutivo. Partiendo de una explicación neurobiológica —¿qué sucedió en el cerebro de una persona un segundo antes de que se comportara así?, ¿qué visión, sonido u olor hicieron que el sistema nervioso produjera ese comportamiento?—, pasamos a pensar en el mundo sensorial y la endocrinología: ¿cómo fue influenciado ese comportamiento por cambios estructurales en el sistema nervioso durante los meses anteriores, por la adolescencia, la infancia y la vida fetal de esa persona, e incluso por su composición genética? Y, más allá del individuo, ¿cómo dio forma la cultura al grupo de ese individuo, qué factores ecológicos milenarios formaron esa cultura? El resultado es uno de los recorridos más deslumbrantes de la ciencia del comportamiento humano jamás propuestos, que puede responder a muchas preguntas profundas y espinosas sobre el tribalismo y la xenofobia, la jerarquía, la competencia, la moral y el libre albedrío, la guerra y la paz.","author":[{"family":"Sapolsky","given":"Robert M."}],"citation-key":"sapolskyComportate2017","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",4,23]]},"language":"es","note":"Item ID: _:n28","publisher":"ePubLibre","title":"Compórtate","type":"book"},

Latour began as a lover of science and technology, co-founder of actor-network theory, and philosopher of a modernity that had \"never been modern.\" In the meantime he is regarded not just as one of the most intelligent and also popular exponents of science studies but also as a major innovator of the social sciences, an exemplary wanderer who walks the line between the sciences and the humanities. This book provides the first comprehensive overview of the Latourian oeuvre, from his early anthropological studies in Abidjan (Ivory Coast), to influential books like Laboratory Life and Science in Action, and his most recent reflections on an empirical metaphysics of \"modes of existence.\" In the course of this enquiry it becomes clear that the basic problem to which Latour's work responds is that of social tradition, the transmission of experience and knowledge. What this empirical philosopher constantly grapples with is the complex relationship of knowledge, time, and culture\" ; \"Bruno Latour is one of the major figures of contemporary thought.

The specific objective of this brief reflection is to offer an alternative vision to the definition of life taking as a starting point the traits common to all living beings. Results and Conclusions: Thus, I define life as a process that takes place in highly organized organic structures and is characterized by being preprogrammed, interactive, adaptative and evolutionary. If life is the process, living beings are the system in which this process takes place. I also wonder whether viruses can be considered living things or not. Taking as a starting point my definition of life and, of course, on what others have thought about it, I am in favor of considering viruses as living beings. I base this conclusion on the fact that viruses satisfy all the vital characteristics common to all living things and on the role they have played in the evolution of species. Finally, I argue that if there were life elsewhere in the universe, it would be very similar to what we know on this planet because the laws of physics and the composition of matter are universal and because of the principle of the inexorability of life.","author":[{"family":"Schrodinger","given":"Erwin"}],"citation-key":"Schrodinger1944","DOI":"10.1007/s11033-021-06594-5","ISSN":"15734978","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["1944"]]},"page":"6223–6230","PMID":"34318436","title":"What is life?","type":"article-journal","volume":"48"},

However, it is difficult to address its function since the usual conception of notation in music scholarship is at odds with studying performance in the first place. This article presents a methodological outline for an ethnomusicology of music notation by investigating the musicality of notation not in terms of its representation of musical structures, but in terms of its mediation of the social and creative agency of musicians. It is suggested that, rather than detracting from musical reality, notation composes musical cultures. This constructive work is simultaneously ontological and ethical. It is described in terms of three distinct processes, namely mobilization, entextualization and remediation. In doing so, this article presents an interdisciplinary approach to a topic that has traditionally defined the disciplinary centre of music scholarship.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Schuiling","given":"Floris"}],"citation-key":"schuilingNotationCulturesEthnomusicology2019","container-title":"Journal of the Royal Musical Association","container-title-short":"J.

To prevent this process from disintegrating, its coherence must be assured.

While it does not attempt to define the still evolving field of artistic research, through the idea of transposition this book aims to grasp a quality increasingly important to artistic practice because representational approaches have been losing traction. Taking to heart the lessons of deconstruction, new modes of epistemic relationships are being invented that include aesthetic dimensions.

However, elastic rods are an important computer animation primitive for which prior sound synthesis methods, such as modal synthesis, are ill-suited for several reasons: large displacements, nonlinear vibrations, dispersion effects, and the geometrically singular nature of rods.\n            In this paper, we present physically based methods for simultaneous generation of animation and sound for deformable rods. We draw on Kirchhoff theory to simplify the representation of rod dynamics and introduce a generalized dipole model to calculate the spatially varying acoustic radiation. In doing so, we drastically decrease the amount of precomputation required (in some cases eliminating it completely), while being able to resolve sound radiation for arbitrary body deformations encountered in computer animation.

Central to the paper is an understanding of ‘interaction' as a network of interdependencies among system components, and as a means for dynamical behaviour to emerge upon the contact of an autonomous system (e.g. a DSP unit) with the external environment (room or else hosting the performance).

  {"id":"sdrauligRecenAudioScores","abstract":"A growing body of contemporary composers produces audio scores where sound is the integral mediator between the composer and performer. While many musical scores deploy some form of symbolic visual representation of sound or movement, audio scores represent information and instructions in the same domain as the performed product. This paper aims to survey the affordances and limitations of audio scores enacted thus far. Within the field, we identify two primary sub-categories associated with the temporal relations between performer and audio score: reactive and rehearsed. Louis d’Heudieres’ Laughter Studies 1-3 (2015-16) and Lara Stanic’s Open Air Bach (2005, rev. 2013) are examples of reactive audio scores. Representative examples of rehearsed audio scores include Carola Bauckholt’s Zugvögel (2011-12) and Cassandra Miller’s Guide (2013). These primary sub-categories may be combined and hybridized to varying degrees, as in Carolyn Chen’s Adagio (2009). Finally, in light of our survey of the possibilities offered by audio scores, we propose some further avenues of exploration for creative practice.","author":[{"family":"Sdraulig","given":"Charlie"},{"family":"Lortie","given":"Chris"}],"citation-key":"sdrauligRecenAudioScores","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Recen audio Scores","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"searbyLigetisChamberConcerto1989","abstract":"György Ligeti's music of the 1970s shows a distinct change of direction in its main preoccupation. Up to the middle 1970s his dominant concern was with textural elements, note-cluster development and the use of strict canons to create ‘Mikropolyphonie’. Mikropolyphonie is usually generated by a canonic development where each entry uses the same pitch array but also has a unique rhythmic shape and is therefore unlike-a normal canon (Example 1, below, is a good illustration). Melody, non-cluster harmony, and rhythmic clarity were not usually significant features. However the opera\n              Le Grande Macabre\n              (1974–77) shows a clear, unambiguous change of approach and a greater eclecticism; as Ligeti states: ‘In\n              Le Grande Macabre\n              there is less of the static, slowly, gradually evolving music.

  {"id":"searleConsciousnessLanguage2002","abstract":"One of the most important and influential philosophers of the last 30 years, John Searle has been concerned throughout his career with a single overarching question: how can we have a unified and theoretically satisfactory account of ourselves and of our relations to other people and to the natural world? In other words, how can we reconcile our common-sense conception of ourselves as conscious, free, mindful, rational agents in a world that we believe comprises brute, unconscious, mindless, meaningless, mute physical particles in fields of force? The essays in this collection are all related to the broad overarching issue that unites the diverse strands of Searle's work.

  {"id":"seminaraElectronicSkinAchievements2014","abstract":"The skin is one of the main organs of the human body and as such it implements many different and relevant functions, e.g. protection of the inner body organs, detection of cutaneous stimuli, etc. Due to its complexity, the development of artificial, or better, electronic skin (e-skin) is a very challenging goal which involves many different and complementary research areas. Nonetheless, the possible application areas are many and very relevant: e.g. humanoids and industrial robotics, artificial prosthetics, biomedical instrumentation, cyber physical systems, for naming a few. Many research groups are addressing the development of e-skin and the research scenario is exciting and continuously evolving. Due to its very peculiar features, the development of electronic skin can be effectively tackled using a holistic approach. Starting from the system specification definition, the mechanical arrangement of the skin itself (i.e. soft or rigid mechanical support, structural and functional material layers, etc.) needs to be designed and fabricated together with the electronic embedded system, to move toward aspects such as tactile data processing algorithms and the communication channel interface. In this paper, we present and assess the achievements of our research group in this field focusing on the following aspects: (i) The manufacturing technology of sensor arrays based on piezoelectric polymer (PVDF) transduction; (ii) The mixed-mode interface electronics; (iii) The tactile data processing algorithms; (iv) The electronic embedded system. Future trends and research perspectives will be also presented.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Seminara","given":"Lucia"},{"family":"Pinna","given":"Luigi"},{"family":"Ibrahim","given":"Alì"},{"family":"Noli","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Capurro","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Caviglia","given":"Stefano"},{"family":"Gastaldo","given":"Paolo"},{"family":"Valle","given":"Maurizio"}],"citation-key":"seminaraElectronicSkinAchievements2014","container-title":"Procedia Technology","container-title-short":"Procedia Technology","DOI":"10.1016/j.protcy.2014.09.015","ISSN":"22120173","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"language":"en","page":"549-558","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Electronic Skin: Achievements, Issues and Trends","title-short":"Electronic Skin","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2212017314001303","volume":"15"},

  {"id":"shumailovCurseRecursionTraining2024","abstract":"Stable Diffusion revolutionised image creation from descriptive text. GPT-2, GPT-3(.5) and GPT-4 demonstrated astonishing performance across a variety of language tasks. ChatGPT introduced such language models to the general public. It is now clear that large language models (LLMs) are here to stay, and will bring about drastic change in the whole ecosystem of online text and images. In this paper we consider what the future might hold. What will happen to GPT-{n} once LLMs contribute much of the language found online? We find that use of model-generated content in training causes irreversible defects in the resulting models, where tails of the original content distribution disappear. We refer to this effect as model collapse1 and show that it can occur in Variational Autoencoders, Gaussian Mixture Models and LLMs. We build theoretical intuition behind the phenomenon and portray its ubiquity amongst all learned generative models. We demonstrate that it has to be taken seriously if we are to sustain the benefits of training from large-scale data scraped from the web. Indeed, the value of data collected about genuine human interactions with systems will be increasingly valuable in the presence of content generated by LLMs in data crawled from the Internet.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Shumailov","given":"Ilia"},{"family":"Shumaylov","given":"Zakhar"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Yiren"},{"family":"Gal","given":"Yarin"},{"family":"Papernot","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Anderson","given":"Ross"}],"citation-key":"shumailovCurseRecursionTraining2024","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,14]]},"language":"en","number":"arXiv:2305.17493","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"The Curse of Recursion: Training on Generated Data Makes Models Forget","title-short":"The Curse of Recursion","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17493"},

Aquí se presenta todo lo que escribió Simondon sobre la técnica además del ya clásico El modo de existencia de los objetos técnicos. Es imposible que no se encuentre algo de interés entre todos estos temas. Simondon es una salsa que va bien con cualquier plato, pero a condición de que se sepa qué se cocina: una nueva idea de técnica, que de hecho rechaza hablar de técnica en general, como si una silla fuera igual que un avión, y que prefiere analizar niveles de tecnicidad. Simondon nos alerta sobre nuestro modo de existencia que incluye a los sistemas técnicos pero no los entiende, y nos pide que volvamos a pensar todo, comenzando por el modo en que se concibe la cultura: como el reino de lo simbólico y lo imaginario, y no como la materia que somos. La idea de una “cultura material” está en boga en algunos medios. Pues bien, Simondon no solo la asumió como suya hace muchos años, sino que nos está enseñando cómo vivirla. Ya se ha dicho, pero no está de más repetirlo: en medio de su infinita erudición sobre temas para los cuales no hay eruditos, Simondon nos muestra otro modo de estar y de sentir.

  {"id":"smithNewTechniqueRapid1997","abstract":"The input acoustic impedance of musical wind instruments necessarily has a dramatic variation with frequency. Our technique uses an acoustic current source whose output is calibrated on a purely resistive load, provided by a ‘semi-infinite’ cylindrical pipe. The frequencies, amplitudes and phases of the sinusoidal components in the stimulus are chosen explicitly to provide the desired frequency resolution and range, and also to optimise the signal to noise ratio. A stimulus waveform is then synthesized from this set of frequency components. The acoustic current is produced using a loudspeaker coupled to the system under study via an exponential horn and an acoustic attentuator with a large acoustic impedance. This allows rapid, high precision measurements over a wide dynamic range. This permits us to investigate the air-jet family of instruments, which operate at the minima in impedance, and which require therefore a large dynamic range in measurement. We have conducted a detailed study of some members of this family. Aspects of the sound and playing behaviour of the instrument in any particular configuration or fingering can often be explained by the frequency dependence of the impedance, in particular the frequencies, depths, bandwidths and harmonicities of the impedance minima which together determine a playing regime.","author":[{"family":"Smith","given":"John"},{"family":"Fritz","given":"Claudia"},{"family":"Wolfe","given":"Joe"}],"citation-key":"smithNewTechniqueRapid1997","issued":{"date-parts":[["1997"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"A new technique for the rapid measurement of acoustic impedance of wnd instruments","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"smithSmartMachinesService2020","abstract":"In recent decades digital devices have reshaped daily life, while tech companies' stock prices have thrust them to the forefront of the business world. In this rapid, global development, the promise of a new machine age has been accompanied by worries about accelerated joblessness thanks to new forms of automation. Jason E. Smith looks behind the techno-hype to lay out the realities of a period of economic slowdown and expanding debt: low growth rates and an increase of labor-intensive jobs at the bottom of the service sector.

  {"id":"snyderFeedbackTromboneControlling2018","abstract":"The New Instrument Research Laboratory at Princeton University presents its research on control of audio feedback in brass instruments through the development of a new electroacoustic instrument, the Feedback Trombone. The Feedback Trombone (FBT) extends the traditional acoustic trombone with a speaker, microphone, and custom analog and digital hardware. Signal from a microphone on the bell of the trombone is processed by a microcontroller-based DSP system and fed back in to the trombone through a speaker driver, inducing oscillation and resonating the body of the instrument. We gained control of the timbre and pitch of the resulting sound by (1) applying ﬁltering and compression in the processing stage, and (2) controlling microphone and speaker placement (see Figure 1). In this paper, we describe the development of the Feedback Trombone and discuss what we learned about controlling the timbre and pitch of the instrument.","author":[{"family":"Snyder","given":"Jeff"},{"family":"Erramilli","given":"Rajeev"},{"family":"Mulshine","given":"Mike"}],"citation-key":"snyderFeedbackTromboneControlling2018","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"The Feedback Trombone: Controlling Feedback in Brass Instruments","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"solomosCellularAutomataXenakiss2005","abstract":"Cellular automata are developed since some decades, belonging to the field of abstract automata. In the beginning of the 1980s, they were popularized in relationship with the study of dynamic systems and chaos theories. They were also applied for modelling the evolution of natural systems (for instance biological ones), especially in relationship with the idea of auto-organization. From the end of the 1980s since nowadays, several composers begin to use cellular automata. Xenakis must have been one of the first (or the first), as he used them, probably for the first time, in Horos (1986), so as to produce harmonic progressions and new timbre combinations. His use of cellular automata seems to be limited. This paper has three aims: 1. To try to understand the reasons why Xenakis used cellular automata. This will mean a discussion of the idea of “automaton”, characterized as a model of autonomy (as opposed to the model of the “command”); 2. To analyze three instances of musical implementations of cellular automata in Horos; 3. To discuss the notion of “theory” specific to Xenakis. Based on the analysis of scores and of sketches (Archives Xenakis, Bibliothèque nationale de France), the analysis of musical implementations of cellular automata in Horos will show that Xenakis acts as he is always acting when he is appealing to one or another form of formalization: he uses them to produce a result, allowing himself bricolage (either in the construction of the tool itself, either in the results produced by the tool). In other terms, his use of cellular automata is mediated through manual interventions.","author":[{"family":"Solomos","given":"Makis"}],"citation-key":"solomosCellularAutomataXenakiss2005","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Cellular automata in Xenakis's music.

In order to address the several lines of thought expressed in his writings, this paper attempts to somehow preserve their essential ﬂuidity. This is done by leaning on a simple and non-dialectical opposition: on one side, there is the “Apollonian” element, especially linked to the notion of “abstraction” (having a central position in Xenakis), to his vision of “arts/sciences alloys” (a beautiful theory about the relationship between music and the sciences), and to the concept of “formalization” (not a homogeneous concept in Xenakis). On the other side, there is the “Dionysian” element, referring to the complexity of Xenakis’ inspiration, to the underlying view of nature, and to the search for immediate expression. The paper ﬁnally discusses Xenakis’ notions of time and space, and his emphasis on creativity, two subjects that seem in a way to go beyond the Appollonian/Dionysian opposition and to point to an inner unity proper to the Xenakis’ world.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Solomos","given":"Makis"}],"citation-key":"solomosXenakisThoughtHis2004","container-title":"Journal of New Music Research","container-title-short":"Journal of New Music Research","DOI":"10.1080/0929821042000310603","ISSN":"0929-8215, 1744-5027","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",6]]},"language":"en","page":"125-136","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Xenakis' Thought through his Writings","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0929821042000310603","volume":"33"},

Overturning conventional hierarchies of knowledge, “Dynamic Configurations with Transversal Video” (DCTV) grounds both discursive and audiovisual knowledges within the space of embodied practice, synthesizing insights from historical epistemologist Hans-Jörg Rheinberger and philosopher of science Karen Barad to offer the first rigorous definition of laboratoriality outside a techno-scientific paradigm. In this concise book, nonbinary practitioner-researcher Ben Spatz situates the DCTV method in the context of artistic research and alongside emerging audiovisual methods in other fields, while highlighting its unique characteristics. Across six focused chapters, Making a Laboratory introduces DCTV as a queer feminist adaptation of Jerzy Grotowski’s “poor” theater laboratory and defines its core elements, drawing on a range of thinkers including Giorgio Agamben, Rebecca Schneider, and Hito Steyerl, in order to examine power, identity, and documentation in lab practice. Drawing from the ethical consent practices of the BDSM community, it lays the groundwork for a radical reinvention of audiovisuality from the perspective of embodiment — the audiovisual body.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Spatz","given":"Benjamin"}],"citation-key":"spatzMakingLaboratoryDynamic2020","DOI":"10.21983/P3.0295.1.00","ISBN":"978-1-953035-03-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial Share Alike 4.0 International","medium":"PDF","page":"204pp","publisher":"punctum books","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"Making a Laboratory: Dynamic Configurations with Transversal Video","title-short":"Making a Laboratory","type":"book","URL":"https://punctumbooks.com/titles/making-a-laboratory-dynamic-configurations-with-transversal-video/"},

This pattern of divergence reversed after World War II, and now we are midway through a century of high and accelerating growth in the developing world and a new convergence with the advanced countries'a trend that is set to reshape the world. Michael Spence, winner of the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, explains what happened to cause this dramatic shift in the prospects of the five billion people who live in developing countries. The growth rates are extraordinary, and continuing them presents unprecedented challenges in governance, international coordination, and ecological sustainability. The implications for those living in the advanced countries are great but little understood. Spence clearly and boldly describes what's at stake for all of us as he looks ahead to how the global economy will develop over the next fifty years.

  {"id":"stamRealTimeFluidDynamics2003","abstract":"In this paper we present a simple and rapid implementation of a fluid dynamics solver for game engines. Our tools can greatly enhance games by providing realistic fluid-like effects such as swirling smoke past a moving character. The potential applications are endless. Our algorithms are based on the physical equations of fluid flow, namely the Navier-Stokes equations. These equations are notoriously hard to solve when strict physical accuracy is of prime importance. Our solvers on the other hand are geared towards visual quality. Our emphasis is on stability and speed, which means that our simulations can be advanced with arbitrary time steps. We also demonstrate that our solvers are easy to code by providing a complete C code implementation in this paper. Our algorithms run in real-time for reasonable grid sizes in both two and three dimensions on standard PC hardware, as demonstrated during the presentation of this paper at the conference.","author":[{"family":"Stam","given":"Jos"}],"citation-key":"stamRealTimeFluidDynamics2003","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"sternePoeticsSignalProcessing2011","abstract":"Signal processing is one of the most important and understudied dimensions of contemporary sound cultures and of electronic media more broadly. In the sonic register, it inflects everything from music production, wired or wireless transmission, and radio broadcast to everyday conversation and listening. Because it is embedded in all stages of contemporary sound production, reproduction, and reception, it has remained an elusive subject for critique. This essay considers the poetics of audio signal processing—the figural dimensions of the technical process and the representations of this process in audio-technical discourse. The article focuses on two metaphorical frames commonly applied to signal processing in the everyday language of musicians and audio technologists: cooking and travel. Through a reading of Claude Lévi-Strauss, it suggests that metaphors of rawness and cooking elevate signal processing to a kind of culturing process by which sound is readied for consumption by listeners through specialized technologies and techniques. The argument situates the spatialization of signal flow and the design of circuit topology within long-standing ideas about travel and voyage that inflect Western epistemologies of sound. As metaphors for signal processing, cooking and travel mark cultural locations (e.g., gendered, classed, able-bodied positionalities) much as they do in broader social contexts. Not only is signal processing subject to the critique of representation, it is, more than any other technical register, directly linked to the contemporary cultural politics of perception and reception. Although this article focuses on sound technologies, a full cultural critique of signal processing would consider its central role in every sense register.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Sterne","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Rodgers","given":"Tara"}],"citation-key":"sternePoeticsSignalProcessing2011","container-title":"differences","DOI":"10.1215/10407391-1428834","ISSN":"1040-7391, 1527-1986","issue":"2-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"31-53","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Poetics of Signal Processing","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://read.dukeupress.edu/differences/article/22/2-3/31/60645/The-Poetics-of-Signal-Processing","volume":"22"},

  {"id":"steyerlCondenadosPantalla2014","abstract":"\"El libro recoge una serie de ensayos de la videoartista y crítica Hito Steyerl, publicados en la revista e-flux, en los que se da forma a una crítica de la creación audiovisual en nuestras sociedades hipermediatizadas. En tanto la mente, las emociones y la creatividad tomaron el lugar del cuerpo como las herramientas claves para la producción de valor, es necesario rastrear qué nuevas formas de alienación han surgido en este contexto y cuál es el destino de la práctica y la imaginación política cuando las utopías y deseos colectivos se han desplazado a las pantallas. En la línea de su principal mentor, Harun Farocki, Steyerl se enfrenta al flujo de imágenes producidas por el capitalismo de la información (en especial a las imágenes-basura arrojadas en las playas de las economías digitales) a partir de un enfoque materialista, abordándolas no como representaciones sino como fragmentos del mundo, que participan de él creándolo, modificándolo y padeciendo sus leyes. Desde esta perspectiva, los formatos de baja resolución (AVI o JPEG) son interpretados como lumpenproletariados en la sociedad de clases de las apariencias, condenados por su resolución subestándar en lugar de valorados por transformar la calidad en accesibilidad; las fallas técnicas y glitches de las imágenes digitales son tratadas como heridas, huellas que testimonian la violenta dislocación que sufren al ingresar en el ciberespacio; y la imagen-spam, como una representación invisible -fabricada por máquinas, enviada por bots y capturada por filtros- que circula sin ser jamás vista por ningún ojo humano. La obra de Hito Steyerl, parafraseando a Franco \"Bifo\" Berardi, funciona como una cartografía de la producción mediática en tiempos del semiocapitalismo, que describe con precisión cómo las imágenes son generadas, transportadas y consumidas hoy. Pero también como una cartografía de la sensibilidad emergente a partir de la cual imaginar hacia dónde debemos dirigirnos si queremos descubrir una nueva forma de actividad que ocupe el lugar del arte y la política.\"","author":[{"family":"Steyerl","given":"Hito"}],"citation-key":"steyerlCondenadosPantalla2014","contributor":[{"family":"Berardi","given":"Franco"}],"edition":"1ª ed","event-place":"Buenos Aires","ISBN":"978-987-1622-31-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"language":"spa","note":"OCLC: 913115628","publisher":"Caja Negra","publisher-place":"Buenos Aires","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Los condenados de la pantalla","translator":[{"family":"Expósito","given":"Marcelo"}],"type":"book"},

The catastrophe of the sensible. In this important new book, the leading cultural theorist and philosopher Bernard Stiegler re-examines the relationship between politics and aesthetics in our contemporary hyperindustrial age. Stiegler argues that our epoch is characterized by the seizure of the symbolic by industrial technology, where aesthetics has become both theatre and weapon in an economic war. This has resulted in a ‘symbolic misery' where conditioning substitutes for experience. In today's control societies, aesthetic weapons play an essential role: audiovisual and digital technologies have become a means of controlling the conscious and unconscious rhythms of bodies and souls, of modulating the rhythms of consciousness and life. The notion of an aesthetic engagement, capable of founding a new communal sensibility and a genuine aesthetic community, has largely collapsed today. This is because the overwhelming majority of the population is now totally subjected to the aesthetic conditioning of marketing and therefore estranged from any experience of aesthetic inquiry. That part of the population that continues to experiment aesthetically has turned its back on those who live in the misery of this conditioning. Stiegler appeals to the art world to develop a political understanding of its role. In this volume he pays particular attention to cinema which occupies a unique position in the temporal war that is the cause of symbolic misery: at once industrial technology and art, cinema is the aesthetic experience that can combat conditioning on its own territory. \"Expanding on Deleuzes idea of 'control societies', Bernard Stiegler provocatively diagnoses the 'misery' of contemporary society as a collective exclusion from the creation of symbols. A war is being waged, he argues: capitalistic marketing is the instrument of choice, the battleground is aesthetics and the fight is for the control of affect.\" - N. Katherine Hayles \"In this decisive contribution to a critical understanding of contemporary life, Stiegler demonstrates how mass exclusion from cultural production constitutes a form of generalized impoverishment, threatening to reduce our existence to mere subsistence. Typically though, he also suggests how we might build alternatives to this 'symbolic misery'. This work forms a vital part of Stiegler's essential project.\" - Martin Crowley, Queens College, University of Cambridge","author":[{"family":"Stiegler","given":"Bernard"}],"call-number":"B2430.S7523 D413 2014","citation-key":"Stiegler2014","edition":"English edition","event-place":"Cambridge","ISBN":"978-0-7456-5264-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"118","page":"128","publisher":"Polity Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge","source":"BnF ISBN","title":"Symbolic misery, volume 1: The hyperindustrial epoch","title-short":"Symbolic misery.

  {"id":"Stiegler2020","abstract":"In this series of lectures, delivered at Nanjing University from 2016 to 2019, Bernard Stiegler rethinks the so-called Anthropocene in relation to philosophy's failure to reckon with the manifold and indeed “cosmic” consequences of the entropic and thermodynamic revolution. Beginning with the Oxford Dictionaries' decision to make “post-truth” the 2016 word of the year, and taking this as an opportunity to understand the implications for Heidegger's “history of being”, “history of truth” and Gestell, the first series of lectures enter into an original consideration of the relationship between Socrates and Plato (and of tragic Greece in general) and its meaning for the history of Western philosophy. The following year's lecture series traverse a path from Foucault's biopower to psychopower to neuropower, and then to a critique of neuroeconomics. Revising Husserl's account of retention to focus on the irreducible connection between human memory and technological memory, the lectures culminate in reflections on the significance of neurotechnology in platform capitalism. The concept of hyper-matter is introduced in the lectures of 2019 as requisite for an epistemology that escapes the trap of opposing the material and the ideal in order to respond to the need for a new critique of the notion of information and technological performativity (of which Moore's law both is and is not an example) in an age when the biosphere has become a technosphere.","author":[{"family":"Stiegler","given":"Bernard"}],"citation-key":"Stiegler2020","ISBN":"978-1-78542-079-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"eng","page":"1–381","publisher":"Open Humanities Press","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Nanjing lectures 2016–2019","type":"book"},
  {"id":"Stiegler2020a","abstract":"These lectures outline the project of a general organology, which is to say an account of life when it is no longer just biological but technical, or when it involves not just organic matter but organized inorganic matter. This organology is also shown to require a modified Simondonian account of the shift from vital individuation to a three-stranded process of psychic, collective and technical individuation. Furthermore, such an approach involves extending the Derridean reading of Socrates's discussion of writing as a pharmakon, so that it becomes a more general account of the pharmacological character of retention and protention. By going back to Leroi-Gourhan, we can recognize that this also means pursuing the history of retentional modifications unfolding in the course of the history of what, with Lotka, can also be called exosomatization. It is thus a question of how exteriorization can, today, in an epoch when it becomes digital, and in an epoch that produces vast amounts of entropy at the thermodynamic, biological and noetic levels, still possibly produce new forms of interiorization, that is, new forms of thought, care and desire, amounting to so many chances to struggle against the planetaryscale pharmacological crisis with which we are currently afflicted.Â","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Stiegler","given":"Bernard"}],"citation-key":"Stiegler2020a","container-title":"Derrida Today","container-title-short":"Derrida Today","DOI":"10.3366/DRT.2020.0220","ISSN":"17548519","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","page":"72–94","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Elements for a general organology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.euppublishing.com/doi/10.3366/drt.2020.0220","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"Stockhausen2011","abstract":"publicado en 1955 en el segundo numero de la revista Die Reihe1 (dedicado enteramente a Anton Webern). Posteriormente fue también editado en los Texte2 y en una versión traducida al inglés de Die Reihe3 que se ha tomado como base principal para la presente traducción. Ya que este escrito parece trascender un objetivo analítico, resulta oportuno reseñar brevemente su entorno. Las obras músicales producidas por Stockhausen en ese período son: las Klavierstucke V al XI (195456); Zeitmasse (1955-56), para quinteto de maderas; Gruppen (1955-57), para tres orquestas y Gesang der Junglinge (1955-56), electroacústica. Algunos de los escritos: Weberns Konzert fur 9 instrumente op. 24 (El concierto op. 24 de Webern)4. Wie die Zeit vergeht... (Como transcurre el tiempo...)5 y Zur Situación des Metiers6. Muchos son los escritos-y no sólo de Stockhausen-que describen el sistema serial, o los procedimientos usados en determinadas obras seriales (ya sea en su fase inicial, como en sus posteriores derivaciones). La importancia de este, sin embargo, consiste en que se describe claramente cómo se opera el sistema para generar música. Y la música, para Stockhausen, es \"...tiempo experimentado a través del sonido...\". Por esto es que usa el concepto operativo de tiempo vivencial para describir ese otro aspecto del tiempo que el compositor moldea, a través de la organización del sonido en el tiempo \"cronométrico\". Resulta significativo también su uso del concepto cartesiano de momentum, vinculado, aunque de manera forzosamento metafórica, al grado de sorpresa que tensa el discurso músical. La relación puede establecerse si se piensa en la evaluación que debe realizar el compositor del \"peso\" de las alteraciones sonoras, no solo en función de su velocidad, grado de cambio y densidad momentáneas, sino también en función de las que las precedieron. Como es de suponer, Stockhausen valora un alto grado de dinamismo en la música, pero explica muy claramente que este no es el efectivo (producido por acumulación de contrastes) sino el dinamismo del tiempo vivencial en flujo constante. Por otra parte, y aunque el autor no lo mencione, queda claro luego del análisis que la cancelación del tiempo cronométrico puede producirse con medios mucho más sutiles que la repetición constante. En otro escrito, Como transcurre el tiempo..., Stockhausen se preocupa principalmente por las bases técnicas como herramientas para componer Zeitmasse, las Klavierstuche V-Xl y Gruppen. No analiza estas obras en el sentido antes aludido-se limita a presentar ejemplos-. La audición de estas obras revela, sin embargo, la vigencia de su concepción compositiva en Estructura y tiempo vivencial, que puede tomarse como una referencia valiosa para el aná!isis de su música y la de Anton Webern.

How can we witness the operations of both the law of the Father, which confers symbolic legitimacy in exchange for observing the incest taboo; and the law of slavery, which implicitly sanctions incest precisely because it casts slave offspring outside the pale of human sexuality, and thus, symbolic legitimacy, in the first instance? This article offers the ‘poetics of mu'–a form of writing cut by the structural diglossic haunt of slavery on language, sexuality and history–as a deeper way to think from the locus of a unique form of structural anonymity which radically unravels the laws of genealogy.","author":[{"family":"Stravinsky","given":"Igor"}],"citation-key":"Stravinsky2018","container-title":"Textual practice","DOI":"10.1080/0950236X.2018.1515790","ISSN":"0950236X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"publisher":"Hardvard University Press","title":"Poetics of music in the form of six lessons","type":"chapter"},

  {"id":"sunLiarsNatureNature2023a","abstract":"\"A natural history of cheating from selfish genes to lying politicians. Nature is rife with cheating. Possums play possum, feigning death to cheat predators. Crows cry wolf to scare off rivals. Amphibians and reptiles are inveterate impostors. Even genes and cells cheat. The Liars of Nature and the Nature of Liars explores the evolution of cheating in the natural world, revealing how dishonesty has given rise to wondrous diversity. Blending cutting-edge science with a wealth of illuminating examples--from microscopic organisms to highly intelligent birds and mammals--Lixing Sun shows how cheating in nature relies on two basic rules. One is lying, by which cheaters exploit honest messages in communication signals and use them to serve their own interests. The other is deceiving, by which cheaters exploit the biases and loopholes in the sensory systems of other creatures. Sun demonstrates that cheating serves as a potent catalyst in the evolutionary arms race between the cheating and the cheated, resulting in a biological world teeming with complexity and beauty. Brimming with insight and humor, The Liars of Nature and the Nature of Liars also looks at the prevalence of cheating in human society, identifying the kinds of cheating that spur innovation and cultural vitality and laying down a blueprint for combatting malicious cheating such as fake news and disinformation.\"--","author":[{"family":"Sun","given":"Lixing"}],"call-number":"QH546 .S86 2023","citation-key":"sunLiarsNatureNature2023a","event-place":"Princeton","ISBN":"978-0-691-19860-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"note":"OCLC: on1330195961","number-of-pages":"269","publisher":"Princeton University Press","publisher-place":"Princeton","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"The liars of nature and the nature of liars: cheating and deception in the living world","title-short":"The liars of nature and the nature of liars","type":"book"},
  {"id":"sutcliffeQuantumTheoryMolecules2012","abstract":"Transition state theory was introduced in the 1930s to account for chemical reactions. Central to this theory is the idea of a potential energy surface (PES). It was assumed that such a surface could be constructed using eigensolutions of the Schro¨dinger equation for the molecular (Coulomb) Hamiltonian but at that time such calculations were not posssible. Nowadays quantum mechanical abinitio electronic structure calculations are routine and from their results PESs can be constructed which are believed to approximate those assumed derivable from the eigensolutions. It is argued here that this belief is unfounded. It is suggested that the potential energy surface construction is more appropriately regarded as a legitimate and eﬀective modiﬁcation of quantum mechanics for chemical purposes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Sutcliffe","given":"Brian T."},{"family":"Woolley","given":"R.

This book identifies narrative strategies as mechanisms for meaning and manipulation in games and real life. It shows that the narrative mechanics so clearly identifiable in games are increasingly used (and abused) in politics and social life. They have »many faces«, displays and interfaces. They occur as texts, recipes, stories, dramas in three acts, movies, videos, tweets, journeys of heroes, but also as rewarding stories in games and as narratives in society - such as a career from rags to riches, the concept of modernity or market economy. Below their surface, however, narrative mechanics are a particular type of motivational design - of game mechanics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,13]]},"citation-key":"suterNarrativeMechanicsStrategies2021","collection-title":"Edition Medienwissenschaft","DOI":"10.14361/9783839453452","edition":"1","editor":[{"family":"Suter","given":"Beat"},{"family":"Bauer","given":"René"},{"family":"Kocher","given":"Mela"}],"event-place":"Bielefeld, Germany","ISBN":"978-3-8376-5345-8 978-3-8394-5345-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,10]]},"language":"en","publisher":"transcript Verlag","publisher-place":"Bielefeld, Germany","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Narrative Mechanics: Strategies and Meanings in Games and Real Life","title-short":"Narrative Mechanics","type":"book","URL":"https://www.transcript-open.de/isbn/5345","volume":"82"},

  {"id":"Swithinbank2004","abstract":"In an era of anxiety and fear about a collapsing US economy, few have presented a way to test concrete alternatives to the current neoliberal democracy and its tendency to widen existing inequities along race and class lines. This article presents findings from two parallel applied research projects offered with the hope that a \"mutually based citizenship\" might one day be deployed more broadly to help a nation reconstitute its weakened social infrastructure and renew democracy itself. Through an action-based form of dreaming, the authors demonstrate how the onset of social changes they experienced can also lead to change at the micro level of the self -where one individual comes into being as a subject and agent by helping another also to become a subject and agent. If one aim of education is to prepare diverse groups of citizens for direct civic engagement in a more participatory democracy, the authors show here how \"mutual immanence\" can become a key preconditions to that new democracy. In this period of liminality, where crashing social systems are in various stages of disarray or dysfunctionality, a writing style that combines multiple forms of fiction. dreaming and non-fiction matches the moods and needs of the time. More hybrid writings like this would establish a promising genre in which to track the attitudes and practices of a diverse population as it overcomes the harsh effects of systemic collapse, binds itself together as one nation, and remakes the public sphere.","author":[{"family":"Swithinbank","given":"Chris"}],"citation-key":"Swithinbank2004","DOI":"10.1126/science.305.5681.143i","ISSN":"0036-8075","issue":"5681","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004"]]},"page":"143i–143i","title":"Going back to the source","type":"document","volume":"305"},

  {"id":"syedBlackBoxThinking2015","abstract":"\"Nobody wants to fail. But in highly complex organizations, success can happen only when we confront our mistakes, learn from our own version of a black box, and create a climate where it's safe to fail. We all have to endure failure from time to time, whether it's underperforming at a job interview, flunking an exam, or losing a pickup basketball game. But for people working in safety-critical industries, getting it wrong can have deadly consequences. Consider the shocking fact that preventable medical error is the third-biggest killer in the United States, causing more than 400,000 deaths every year. More people die from mistakes made by doctors and hospitals than from traffic accidents. And most of those mistakes are never made public, because of malpractice settlements with nondisclosure clauses. For a dramatically different approach to failure, look at aviation. Every passenger aircraft in the world is equipped with an almost indestructible black box. Whenever there's any sort of mishap, major or minor, the box is opened, the data is analyzed, and experts figure out exactly what went wrong. Then the facts are published and procedures are changed, so that the same mistakes won't happen again. By applying this method in recent decades, the industry has created an astonishingly good safety record. Few of us put lives at risk in our daily work as surgeons and pilots do, but we all have a strong interest in avoiding predictable and preventable errors. So why don't we all embrace the aviation approach to failure rather than the health-care approach? As Matthew Syed shows in this eye-opening book, the answer is rooted in human psychology and organizational culture. Syed argues that the most important determinant of success in any field is an acknowledgment of failure and a willingness to engage with it. Yet most of us are stuck in a relationship with failure that impedes progress, halts innovation, and damages our careers and personal lives. We rarely acknowledge or learn from failure--even though we often claim the opposite. We think we have 20/20 hindsight, but our vision is usually fuzzy. Syed draws on a wide range of sources--from anthropology and psychology to history and complexity theory--to explore the subtle but predictable patterns of human error and our defensive responses to error. He also shares fascinating stories of individuals and organizations that have successfully embraced a black box approach to improvement, such as David Beckham, the Mercedes F1 team, and Dropbox\"-- Provided by publisher","author":[{"family":"Syed","given":"Matthew"}],"citation-key":"syedBlackBoxThinking2015","ISBN":"978-0-698-40887-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"language":"eng","note":"OCLC: 935082673","publisher":"Penguin Publishing Group","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Black Box Thinking","type":"book"},

However, their sonic character, effect of their contents and bulky conventional treatment solutions, usually remains unchanged. This paper reports a modular volumetric unit’s’s early-stage design, aimed at providing usage flexibility to a group of representative recording rooms. The versatility refers to acoustical (absorption and reflection), practical (volume and weight), and aesthetic aspects. The geometry and materials of the panel were derived parametrically through computer modelling software, by implementing interdependent and adaptable elements to one unit. Existing recording spaces were recreated into computational acoustic models and tested in two states. Simulations of the rooms’ acoustical behavior were run in turn, first with the original treatment, then with the panel replacing the treatment. The design goal was to have minimal differences in Reverberation Time, Early Decay Time, Clarity, Room Frequency Response for every room’s two states. Results showed the panel performing better in rooms with larger volume. Overall, the panel matched the original acoustic response and character of the rooms, while providing versatility when compared to traditional acoustic treatment solutions. The development of such a product would allow future studio users to fine tune the room’s performance according to their needs.","author":[{"family":"Tagios","given":"Stavros"},{"family":"Gomez-Agustina","given":"Luis"}],"citation-key":"tagiosParametricDesignModular2012","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Parametric design of a modular acoustic volumetric unit for indoor recording spaces","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"tenenbaumRationalPowersAction2020","abstract":"Human actions unfold over time, in pursuit of ends that are not fully specified in advance. Rational Powers in Action locates these features of the human condition at the heart of a new theory of instrumental rationality. Where many theories of rational agency focus on instantaneous choices between sharply defined outcomes, treating the temporally extended and partially open-ended character of action as an afterthought, this book argues that the deep structure of instrumental rationality can only be understood if we see how it governs the pursuit of long-term, indeterminate ends. These are ends that cannot be realized through a single momentary action, and whose content leaves partly open what counts as realizing the end. Sergio Tenenbaum argues that we need to focus on temporal duration and the indeterminacy of ends in intentional action, even to explain the rational governance of relatively simple actions. Theories of moment-by-moment preference maximization, or indeed any understanding of instrumental rationality on the basis of momentary mental items, cannot capture the fundamental structure of our instrumentally rational capacities.

  {"id":"thautOxfordHandbookMusic2019","abstract":"The study of music and the brain can be traced back to the work of Gall in the 18th century, continuing with John Hughlings Jackson, August Knoblauch, Richard Wallaschek, and others. These early researchers were interested in localizing musicality in the brain and learning more about how music is processed in both healthy individuals and those with dysfunctions of various kinds. Since then, the research literature has mushroomed, especially in the latter part of the 20th and early 21st centuries. The Oxford Handbook of Music and the Brain is a groundbreaking compendium of current research on music in the human brain. It brings together an international roster of 54 authors from 13 countries providing an essential guide to this rapidly growing field. The major themes include Music, the Brain, and Cultural Contexts; Music Processing in The Human Brain; Neural Responses to Music; Musicianship and Brain Function; Developmental Issues in Music and the Brain; Music, the Brain, and Health; and the Future. Each chapter offers a thorough review of the current status of research literature as well as an examination of limitations of knowledge and suggestions for future advancement and research efforts. The book is valuable for a broad readership including neuroscientists, musicians, clinicians, researchers and scholars from related fields but also readers with a general interest in the topic.","author":[{"family":"Thaut","given":"Michael H."},{"family":"Hodges","given":"Donald A."}],"citation-key":"thautOxfordHandbookMusic2019","collection-title":"Oxford handbooks","edition":"First edition","event-place":"Oxford","ISBN":"978-0-19-880412-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher-place":"Oxford","source":"BnF ISBN","title":"The Oxford handbook of music and the brain","type":"book"},
  {"id":"thepetropunkcollectiveSpeculativeMedievalismsDiscography2020","abstract":"Proceedings from two Speculative Medievalisms symposia, held at King's College London (Jan. 2011) and The Graduate Center, City University of New York (Sep. 2011), and organized by The Petropunk Collective (Eileen Joy, Anna Klosowska, Nicola Masciandaro, and Michael O'Rourke). These interdisciplinary events were dedicated to dialogue and cross-contamination between traditional concepts of speculatio, present-minded premodern studies, and contemporary speculative realist and object-oriented philosophies. In its medieval formulation, speculatio signifies the essentially reflective and imaginative operations of the intellect. Here the world, books, and mind itself are all conceived as specula (mirrors) through which the hermeneutic gaze can gain access to what lies beyond it. \"To know is to bend over a mirror where the world is reflected, to descry images reflected from sphere to sphere: the medieval man was always before a mirror, both when he looked around himself and when he surrendered to his own imagination\" (Giorgio Agamben, Stanzas). Correlatively, speculative realism, as the term suggests, is characterized by the self-contradictory intensity of a desire for thought that can think beyond itself -- a desire that proceeds, like all philosophy, in a twisted and productive relation to the phantasm of the word. Aiming to rise above and tunnel below the thought-being or self-world correlation, speculative realism \"depart[s] from the text-centered hermeneutic models of the past and engage[s] in daring speculations about the nature of reality itself\" (The Speculative Turn). Speculative Medievalisms, like some weird friar-alchemist in an inexistent romance, plays the erotic go-between for these text-centered and text-eccentric intellectual domains by trying to transmute the space between past and present modes of speculation from shared blindness to love at first sight. Possibly succeeding, the volume brings together the work of a motley crew of philosophers and premodernists into prismatic relation","author":[{"literal":"The Petropunk Collective"}],"citation-key":"thepetropunkcollectiveSpeculativeMedievalismsDiscography2020","event-place":"Baltimore, Maryland","ISBN":"978-0-615-74953-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"1","publisher":"Project Muse","publisher-place":"Baltimore, Maryland","source":"K10plus ISBN","title":"Speculative Medievalisms: Discography","title-short":"Speculative Medievalisms","type":"book"},
  {"id":"thibodeauTrumpetAugmentationTechnological2013","abstract":"This article discusses the augmentation of acoustic musical instruments, with a focus on trumpet augmentation. Augmented instruments are acoustic instruments onto which sensors have been mounted in order to provide extra sonic control variables. Trumpets make ideal candidates for augmentation because they have spare physical space on which to mount electronics and spare performer “bandwidth” with which to interact with the augmentations. In this article, underlying concepts of augmented instrument design are discussed along with a review and discussion of twelve existing augmented trumpets and five projects related to mouthpiece augmentation. Common aspects to many of these examples are identified, such as the prevalence of idiosyncratic designs, the use of buttons placed at or near the left-hand playing position, and the focus on measuring or mimicking trumpet valves. Three existing approaches to valve sensing are compared, and a novel method for sensing valve position, based on linear variable differential transformers, is introduced. Based on the review and comparison, we created an example augmented trumpet that tests the feasibility of a modular design paradigm. The results of this review of the state-of-the-art and our own research suggests future directions towards a better understanding of augmented trumpet design.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Thibodeau","given":"Joseph"},{"family":"Wanderley","given":"Marcelo M."}],"citation-key":"thibodeauTrumpetAugmentationTechnological2013","container-title":"Computer Music Journal","container-title-short":"Computer Music Journal","DOI":"10.1162/COMJ_a_00185","ISSN":"0148-9267, 1531-5169","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",9]]},"language":"en","page":"12-25","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Trumpet Augmentation and Technological Symbiosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://direct.mit.edu/comj/article/37/3/12-25/94435","volume":"37"},

  {"id":"tkaczykIntroductionReconsideringResources2023","abstract":"This introduction to the Focus section “Supplied Knowledge: Resource Regimes, Materials, and Epistemic Tools” provides a framework to analyze critically the ways in which knowledge depends on material supplies. It claims that most scientiﬁc technologies of the early modern and modern periods were made possible only by the steady supply of a large variety of so-called natural resources and that the practices necessary to exploit, process, and provide these resources in the quality and quantity required were closely linked with the scientiﬁc and humanistic agendas of their time. The essays assembled here examine select epistemic tools and key materials from which these were made. This introduction shows how the essays apply different scales to reveal the local and global values, epistemic concepts, aesthetic ideals, social systems, (geo)political constellations, and economic frameworks that have co-constituted the making of scientiﬁc instruments, artifacts, and knowledge in and beyond the Global North.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Tkaczyk","given":"Viktoria"},{"family":"Von Oertzen","given":"Christine"}],"citation-key":"tkaczykIntroductionReconsideringResources2023","container-title":"Isis","container-title-short":"Isis","DOI":"10.1086/724796","ISSN":"0021-1753, 1545-6994","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,1]]},"language":"en","note":"MAG ID: 4376869980\nS2ID: 92dd4727af31d59bb99e855526d6df41ed049f0d","page":"359-365","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Introduction: Reconsidering the Resources of Epistemic Tools","title-short":"Introduction","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/724796","volume":"114"},

She introduces her working team members and their research objects, which encompass a range of several works dealing with the situation of sound and music within the sciences since the Scientific Revolution. As she highlights the importance of some actors who tend to be omitted, she points out how another conception and history of sciences arose. She also shows how sound can be used, like Mach did for example, as a tool of knowledge in order to investigate fieldworks that might not be related to sound at first sight, or to build up laboratories, to produce new objects and so on. She draws a condensed survey of works, very little known in France yet, that combine History of Sciences, Sound Studies and Music Knowledge. Music and sound are addressed from the perspective of the history sciences, including measures and standardization; and simultaneously, the history of sciences is sort of considered through a “re-sonification”.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Tkaczyk","given":"Viktoria"},{"family":"Ribac","given":"François"}],"citation-key":"tkaczykResearchHistoryModern2019","container-title":"Revue d'anthropologie des connaissances","container-title-short":"rac","DOI":"10.4000/rac.1674","ISSN":"1760-5393","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Research in the history of modern acoustics: Interview with Viktoria Tkaczyk, Director of the Epistemes of Modern Acoustics, Max Planck Institute for the History of Science, Berlin","title-short":"Research in the history of modern acoustics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.openedition.org/rac/1674","volume":"13"},

But from there, the book expands its reach. At its core, \"cursed\" thinking underlies almost everything people write, say, and think about both other people and our own pasts. The more information we have about something, and the more experience we have with it, the harder it is to step outside that experience.

  {"id":"toewsGabrielTardeFuture2022","abstract":"This book presents the core ideas of early sociologist Gabriel Tarde and suggests a new pathway for sociology based on his foundational work. Rejecting anthropocentrism, Tarde highlights the contrast between the natural and the artificial, uniquely emphasizing the positive significance of the artificial in an age in which people have come to distrust it profoundly. Recovering Tarde's theory today in the context of contemporary as well as classical scholarship, recognizing how it fits with such phenomena as quantum physics and digital media, this book develops the concept of the cosmological imagination as the context for a critical Tardian analysis of artifice that can bring together what we know about our contemporary future-oriented global societies. How we know the universe, our place in it, the place of other animals and objects in it, our global socialities, our human claims of power and privilege within it, are pointed questions Tarde asks as he wonders whether a future temporality conducive to constant artifice has become our normal human way of life. Considering our ambivalence about modern products and modernity in general, our thinking about the future and our tendency to forget what nature used to signify in its presentation of problems beyond our control, such as illnesses and epidemics, Gabriel Tarde: The Future of the Artificial demonstrates the reasons for which we need to return to Tarde's work rediscover its relevance for public debate, as we seek to think through the new era and its societies in which culture and nature are no longer distinct.

  {"id":"tomaselloBecomingHumanTheory2019","abstract":"Virtually all theories of how humans have become such a distinctive species focus on evolution. Here, Michael Tomasello proposes a complementary theory of human uniqueness, focused on ontogenetic processes. His data-driven model explains how those things that make us most human are constructed during the first years of a child's life. Tomasello assembles nearly three decades of experimental work with chimpanzees, bonobos, and human children to propose a new framework for psychological development between birth and seven years of age. He identifies eight pathways that starkly differentiate humans from their closest primate relatives: social cognition, communication, cultural learning, cooperative thinking, collaboration, prosociality, social norms, and moral identity. In each of these, great apes possess rudimentary abilities. But then, Tomasello argues, the maturation of humans' evolved capacities for shared intentionality transform these abilities into uniquely human cognition and sociality. The first step occurs around nine months, with the emergence of joint intentionality, exercised mostly with caregiving adults. The second step occurs around three years, with the emergence of collective intentionality involving both authoritative adults, who convey cultural knowledge, and coequal peers, who elicit collaboration and communication. Finally, by age six or seven, children become responsible for self-regulating their beliefs and actions so that they comport with cultural norms. Built on the essential ideas of Lev Vygotsky, Becoming Human places human sociocultural activity within the framework of modern evolutionary theory, and shows how biology creates the conditions under which culture does its work.--","author":[{"family":"Tomasello","given":"Michael"}],"call-number":"BF713 .T655 2019","citation-key":"tomaselloBecomingHumanTheory2019","event-place":"Cambridge, Massachusetts","ISBN":"978-0-674-98085-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"379","publisher":"The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge, Massachusetts","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Becoming human: a theory of ontogeny","title-short":"Becoming human","type":"book"},

A partir de ese episodio -que desde su punto de vista representa el inicio del siglo XX musical- Toop sigue las huellas de un proceso de erosión de géneros y categorías del que surgirá una cultura sonora etérea, desterritorializada e inmersiva, que preparó nuestra sensibilidad para el océano de información digital en el que actualmente estamos sumergidos. La Monte Young, Brian Wilson, The Velvet Underground, Sun Ra, Brian Eno, Lee Perry, Kraftwerk, Aphex Twin y Ryuichi Sakamoto se interconectan en esta extraordinaria obra de historia sonora que nos transporta desde la selva amazónica hasta Tokio, y se proyecta desde las mitologías ancestrales hasta el surgimiento de la música ambient y el techno.

  {"id":"tournemenneBrassInstrumentsDesign2017","abstract":"This paper presents a method for design optimization of brass wind instruments. The shape of a trumpet's bore is optimized to improve intonation using a physics-based sound simulation model. This physics-based model consists of an acoustic model of the resonator, a mechanical model of the excitator, and a model of the coupling between the excitator and the resonator. The harmonic balance technique allows the computation of sounds in a permanent regime, representative of the shape of the resonator according to control parameters of the virtual musician. An optimization problem is formulated in which the objective function to be minimized is the overall quality of the intonation of the different notes played by the instrument. The design variables are the physical dimensions of the resonator. Given the computationally expensive function evaluation and the unavailability of gradients, a surrogate-assisted optimization framework is implemented using the mesh adaptive direct search algorithm (MADS). Surrogate models are used both to obtain promising candidates in the search step of MADS and to rank-order additional candidates generated by the poll step of MADS. The physics-based model is then used to determine the next design iterate. Two examples (with two and five design optimization variables) demonstrate the approach. Results show that significant improvement of intonation can be achieved at reasonable computational cost. Finally, the perspectives of this approach for computer-aided instrument design are evoked, considering optimization algorithm improvements and problem formulation modifications using for instance different design variables, multiple objectives and constraints or objective functions based on the instrument's timbre.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Tournemenne","given":"Robin"},{"family":"Petiot","given":"Jean-François"},{"family":"Talgorn","given":"Bastien"},{"family":"Kokkolaras","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Gilbert","given":"Joël"}],"citation-key":"tournemenneBrassInstrumentsDesign2017","container-title":"Journal of Mechanical Design","DOI":"10.1115/1.4035503","ISSN":"1050-0472, 1528-9001","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"041401","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Brass Instruments Design Using Physics-Based Sound Simulation Models and Surrogate-Assisted Derivative-Free Optimization","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/mechanicaldesign/article/doi/10.1115/1.4035503/421959/Brass-Instruments-Design-Using-PhysicsBased-Sound","volume":"139"},

Changes in culture and developments in science drove musical progress from printing and distribution to instrumental improvements, innovation, and the acoustics of buildings and concert halls. Every aspect increased public demand and changed compositional styles, plus heightened the need for virtuosic star performers. Conversely, the attempts to record and distribute music inspired the growth of recording systems, microphones, and electronic amplifiers, which has resulted in the electronically dominated world as we now know it. The book maps these continuous changes and how they have influenced musical evolution, and it not only explores the past, but attempts to predict the near future in terms of the potential for new electronic instruments and the ongoing shifts between recording and broadcasting techniques (tapes, vinyl, CDs, streaming, etc.), together with their impact on, and the survival of, the music industry. Examples of changes for keyboard, string, and brass instruments, current understanding of voice production, hearing, and brain processing of music are all discussed.

Humans occasionally use growl-like voices to express excessive emotions. Acoustically characterized by loud dynamics and low values of the harmonic-to-noise ratio, growl-like sounds usually express anger and excitement associated with aggression. We propose a biomechanical model relating the aggressive characteristic of the growl-like timbre to the motor mechanisms underlying growl production in humans, highlighting how an abdominal muscle contraction enhances spine stability, which plays a critical role in physical attacks. This model was supported by the experimental data of activation of the deepest abdominal muscle during resting, singing, and growling. We found a significant positive correlation between the abdominal muscle activity associated with producing voice and the perceived aggressiveness intensity of voice. The cognition of growl-like sounds is discussed from the perspectives of biomechanics, evolutionary biology, and cognitive science.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Tsai","given":"Chen-Gia"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Li-Ching"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Shwu-Fen"},{"family":"Shau","given":"Yio-Wha"},{"family":"Hsiao","given":"Tzu-Yu"},{"family":"Auhagen","given":"Wolfgang"}],"citation-key":"tsaiAggressivenessGrowlLikeTimbre2010","container-title":"Music Perception","DOI":"10.1525/mp.2010.27.3.209","ISSN":"0730-7829, 1533-8312","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"209-222","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Aggressiveness of the Growl-Like Timbre: Acoustic Characteristics, Musical Implications, and Biomechanical Mechanisms","title-short":"Aggressiveness of the Growl-Like Timbre","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://online.ucpress.edu/mp/article/27/3/209/62449/Aggressiveness-of-the-Growl-Like-Timbre-Acoustic","volume":"27"},

  {"id":"tullbergAffordancesMusicalInstruments2022","abstract":"While the concept of affordances has been applied in music research, it has not been satisfyingly developed regarding musical instruments. The resulting vagueness restricts the potential of the concept to guide exploration, discussion, and development of new approaches towards musical learning. Also, the concept of affordances comes with strong ontological claims and thus prompts the researcher to be careful when merging it with other theoretical domains or applying it in empirical studies. Consequently, the present article aims at contributing to a conceptualization of affordances of musical instruments by highlighting and discussing components that are necessary to consider in such a project. The first part consists of an overview of key elements of ecological psychology and more recent theoretical contributions, which are of relevance to the aim of the article: Material Engagement Theory, Skilled Intentionality Framework, and Sensorimotor Contingency Theory. A brief review of examples on how the concept of affordances has been applied in music research is presented. The main section of the article discusses four components, vital to further theoretical developments on affordances of musical instruments: the musical niche, spatial networks, sensorimotor relationship, and the amodal nature of affordances. Central to the argument is an understanding of affordances as relational, limited in scope and bound up with the physical interaction between musician and instrument. Accordingly, it is proposed that analytical focus in studies of musical instruments should be the sensorimotor relationship, spatiotemporally unfolding through a musical event. The article is concluded with comments upon educational implications of the presented perspective and suggestions on further research on the topic.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Tullberg","given":"Markus"}],"citation-key":"tullbergAffordancesMusicalInstruments2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front.

In multiple presentations during the mid-1960s, Xenakis linked his theory of Sieves, a theory enabling the construction of complex symmetries, to the pre-modern sources of the European tradition, nonwestern musics and the music of his Greek heritage. With the theories of Aristoxenos and the ancient Greeks, the musical practice of the Byzantine church and ethnomusicology, Xenakis marshaled an unforgiving critique of the contemporary avant-garde, which he viewed as mired in the confines of serialism and the revisionist perspectives of contemporary musicology.","author":[{"family":"Turner","given":"Charles"}],"citation-key":"turnerVersMetamusiqueXenakis2005","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"“vers Une Métamusique”: Xenakis, Sieve Theory and Cultural Plurality","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"tuuriUnderstandingHumanTechnology2020","abstract":"In this paper, we outline a theoretical account of the relationship between technology and human musicality. An enactive and biocultural position is adopted that assumes a close coevolutionary relationship between the two. From this position, we aim at clarifying how the present and emerging technologies, becoming embedded and embodied in our lifeworld, inevitably co-constitute and transform musical practices, skills, and ways of making sense of music. Therefore, as a premise of our scrutiny, we take it as a necessity to more deeply understand the ways that humans become afﬁliated to the ever-changing instruments of music technology, in order to better understand the coevolutionary impact on learning and other aspects of musicality being constituted together with these instruments. This investigation is particularly motivated by the rapid and diverse development of mobile applications and their potential impact, as musical instruments, on learning and cognizing music. The term appiﬁcation refers to enactive processes in which applications (i.e., apps) and their user interfaces, developed for various ecosystems of mobile smart technology, partake in reorganizing our ways of musical acting and thinking. On the basis of the theoretical analysis, we argue that understanding the phenomenon of the human–technology relationship, and its implications for our embodied musical minds, requires acknowledging (1) how apps contribute to conceptual constructing of musical activities, (2) how apps can be designed or utilized in a way that reinforces the epistemological continuum between embodied and abstract sense-making, and (3) how apps become merged with musical instruments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Tuuri","given":"Kai"},{"family":"Koskela","given":"Oskari"}],"citation-key":"tuuriUnderstandingHumanTechnology2020","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front.

  {"id":"valleSampCompSamplebasedTechniques2018","abstract":"The paper introduces a series of techniques for algorithmic composition in which compositional data are extracted from audio at the sample level. In this way, typical Digital Signal Processing operations can act as tools to create/retrieve music materials. First, in order to describe audio-driven processes in composition, the notion of audioparity is introduced. Secondly, various approaches are discussed that map sample values to composition events. The implementation of these processes is then presented, in particular in relation to music notation generation. Finally, the paper discusses some applications of the same techniques to physical computing.","author":[{"family":"Valle","given":"Andrea"}],"citation-key":"valleSampCompSamplebasedTechniques2018","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"SampComp: sample-based techniques for algorithmic composition","type":"article-journal"},

As a result, music-making has become more widespread and convenient. However, the blackboxing practices of commercial Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs) have conditioned many users to produce only speciﬁc styles of music. Furthermore, as many of these commercial instruments produce sound through loudspeakers, rather than the body of the instrument, players lose the physical and tactile connection to sound and music. Consequently, these DMIs inhibit understanding of the relationship between musicality and our everyday physical world, and cut players off from exploring a more extensive range of musical possibilities.","author":[{"family":"Troyer","given":"Akito","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Machover","given":"Tod"},{"family":"Maes","given":"Pattie"}],"citation-key":"vantroyerScoreInstruments2018","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Score Instruments","type":"article-journal"},

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring signiﬁcantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.0 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.","author":[{"family":"Vaswani","given":"Ashish"},{"family":"Shazeer","given":"Noam"},{"family":"Parmar","given":"Niki"},{"family":"Uszkoreit","given":"Jakob"},{"family":"Jones","given":"Llion"},{"family":"Gomez","given":"Aidan N"},{"family":"Kaiser","given":"Łukasz"},{"family":"Polosukhin","given":"Illia"}],"citation-key":"vaswaniAttentionAllYou2017","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Attention is All you Need","type":"article-journal"},

To this end, we have taken from Narratology, archetypal objects that one may identify as “magic”, the uses and properties of which often provide powers and potential to the protagonists of stories to evolve into heroes and open a door to the world of adventure. These everyday objects, taken from stories and converted into tangible objects, allow the user, within an interactive experience, to have a “natural” interaction that encourages discovering new potential through action, while guiding and involving her in the adventure and transforming her into the protagonist of the fiction experience. The Virtual Subjectiveness, as an interaction design model, provides the user with coherent point of view that is transformed along the journey by the use of these special objects. This conforms an original view on everyday objects as narrative engines within real time generated experiences. A guide for interaction design and a renewed model of interaction based on specifications of the medium provide designers and authors with analytic and production tools for creating interactive experiences into the same framework.","author":[{"family":"Vázquez","given":"Carmen Platero"}],"citation-key":"vazquezObjetosMagicosObjetos2016","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"es","source":"Zotero","title":"Objetos mágicos:  los objetos como transformadores  de la Subjetividad virtual  en la creación de aventuras interactivas  en sistemas de realidad mixta","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"velozConceptualNetworkbasedApproach2013","abstract":"The application of conventional phylogenetic techniques for inferring cultural history is problematic due to differences in the nature of information transmission in biological and cultural realms. In culture, units of transmission are not just measurable attributes, but communicable concepts. Therefore, relatedness amongst cultural elements often resides at the conceptual level not captured by traditional phylogenetic methods. This paper takes a cognitively inspired approach to analyzing material cultural history. We show that combining data for physical attributes of cultural artifacts with conceptual information can uncover cultural influences among different ethnolinguistic groups, and reveal new patterns of cultural ancestry. Using the Baltic psaltery, a musical instrument with a well-documented ethnographic and archaeological record, we recovered a previously unacknowledged pattern of historical relationship that is more congruent with geographical distribution and temporal data than is obtained with other approaches.","author":[{"family":"Veloz","given":"Tomas"},{"family":"Gabora","given":"Liane"},{"family":"Tëmkin","given":"Ilya"}],"citation-key":"velozConceptualNetworkbasedApproach2013","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"A conceptual network-based approach to inferring cultural phylogenies","type":"article-journal"},

The microphones on the smallscale device are sampled using a single, simultaneously sampling analog to digital converter which results in time synchronization between these microphone channels up to a small fraction of the signal’s phase. The large-scale array consists of multiple smallscale devices and can be deployed over a much larger capture volume.

Movement, speech, and corporeal percussion have emerged as essential learning resources for rhythm classes. In the current educational situation and in levels beyond the initial stage, however, there exists a lack of awareness and a limitation of the ample possibilities offered by rhythm. This attitude is influenced in part by the type of content studied, which focuses on the metric and logical-mathematical but ignores lived experience and musical perception. As a remedy, this article proposes supplemental (or additive) rhythms to complement training in rhythmic education. The explication consists of two parts: a theoretical review and self-assessment that seek to justify and analyze the nature of these rhythmic patterns and their application in the classroom through the design and development of an tempting teaching proposal.","author":[{"family":"Vilar","given":"José María Peñalver"}],"citation-key":"vilarFormacionRitmicaRitmos2013","container-title":"REVISTA ELECTRÓNICA DE LEEME","issue":"32","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"language":"es","source":"Zotero","title":"Formación rítmica: los ritmos aditivos y su aplicación pedagógica en la educación musical","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"visiInstrumentalMovementsNeophytes2015","abstract":"Body movement and embodied knowledge play an important part in how we express and understand music. The gestures of a musician playing an instrument are part of a shared knowledge that contributes to musical expressivity by building expectations and inﬂuencing perception. In this study, we investigate the extent in which the movement vocabulary of violin performance is part of the embodied knowledge of individuals with no experience in playing the instrument. We asked people who cannot play the violin to mime a performance along an audio excerpt recorded by an expert. They do so by using a silent violin, speciﬁcally modiﬁed to be more accessible to neophytes. Preliminary motion data analyses suggest that, despite the individuality of each performance, there is a certain consistency among participants in terms of overall rhythmic resonance with the music and movement in response to melodic phrasing. Individualities and commonalities are then analysed using Functional Principal Component Analysis.","author":[{"family":"Visi","given":"Federico"},{"family":"Coorevits","given":"Esther"},{"family":"Schramm","given":"Rodrigo"},{"family":"Miranda","given":"Eduardo"}],"citation-key":"visiInstrumentalMovementsNeophytes2015","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Instrumental Movements of Neophytes","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"volppSubstanceFictionLiterary2022","abstract":"\"Do the portrayals of objects in literary texts represent historical evidence about the material culture of the past? Or are things in books more than things in the world? Sophie Volpp considers fictional objects of the late Ming and Qing that defy being read as illustrative of historical things. Instead, she argues, fictional objects are often signs of fictionality themselves, calling attention to the nature of the relationship between literature and materiality. Volpp examines a series of objects--a robe, a box and a shell, a telescope, a plate-glass mirror, and a painting-drawn from the canonical works frequently mined for information about late imperial material culture, including the novels The Plum in the Golden Vase and The Story of the Stone as well as the short fiction of Feng Menglong, Ling Mengchu, and Li Yu. She argues that although fictional objects invite readers to think of them as illustrative, in fact, inconsistent and discontinuous representation disconnects the literary object from potential historical analogues. The historical resonances of literary objects illuminate the rhetorical strategies of individual works of fiction and, more broadly, conceptions of fictionality in the Ming and Qing. Rather than offering a transparent lens on the past, fictional objects train the reader to be aware of the fallibility of perception. A deeply insightful analysis of late Ming and Qing texts and reading practices, The Substance of Fiction has important implications for Chinese literary studies, history, and art history, as well as the material turn in the humanities\"--","author":[{"family":"Volpp","given":"Sophie"}],"call-number":"PL2436 .V65 2022","citation-key":"volppSubstanceFictionLiterary2022","collection-title":"Premodern East Asia: new horizons","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-0-231-19964-3 978-0-231-19965-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"number-of-pages":"245","publisher":"Columbia University Press","publisher-place":"New York","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"The substance of fiction: literary objects in China, 1550-1775","title-short":"The substance of fiction","type":"book"},

  {"id":"wald-fuhrmannMusicListeningClassical2021","abstract":"Performing and listening to music occurs in speciﬁc situations, requiring speciﬁc media. Empirical research on music listening and appreciation, however, tends to overlook the effects these situations and media may have on the listening experience. This article uses the sociological concept of the frame to develop a theory of an aesthetic experience with music as the result of encountering sound/music in the context of a speciﬁc situation. By presenting a transdisciplinary sub-ﬁeld of empirical (concert) studies, we unfold this theory for one such frame: the classical concert. After sketching out the underlying theoretical framework, a selective literature review is conducted to look for evidence on the general plausibility of the single elements of this emerging theory and to identify desiderata. We refer to common criticisms of the standard classical concert, and how new concert formats try to overcome alleged shortcomings and detrimental effects. Finally, an empirical research program is proposed, in which frames and frame components are experimentally manipulated and compared to establish their respective affordances and effects on the musical experience. Such a research program will provide empirical evidence to tackle a question that is still open to debate, i.e., whether the diversiﬁed world of modern-day music listening formats also holds a place for the classical concert – and if so, for what kind of classical concert.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Wald-Fuhrmann","given":"Melanie"},{"family":"Egermann","given":"Hauke"},{"family":"Czepiel","given":"Anna"},{"family":"O’Neill","given":"Katherine"},{"family":"Weining","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Meier","given":"Deborah"},{"family":"Tschacher","given":"Wolfgang"},{"family":"Uhde","given":"Folkert"},{"family":"Toelle","given":"Jutta"},{"family":"Tröndle","given":"Martin"}],"citation-key":"wald-fuhrmannMusicListeningClassical2021","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front.

In particular, we show how such reasoning abilities emerge naturally in sufficiently large language models via a simple method called chain of thought prompting, where a few chain of thought demonstrations are provided as exemplars in prompting. Experiments on three large language models show that chain of thought prompting improves performance on a range of arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks. The empirical gains can be striking. For instance, prompting a 540B-parameter language model with just eight chain of thought exemplars achieves state of the art accuracy on the GSM8K benchmark of math word problems, surpassing even finetuned GPT-3 with a verifier.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Wei","given":"Jason"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xuezhi"},{"family":"Schuurmans","given":"Dale"},{"family":"Bosma","given":"Maarten"},{"family":"Ichter","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Xia","given":"Fei"},{"family":"Chi","given":"Ed"},{"family":"Le","given":"Quoc"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Denny"}],"citation-key":"weiChainofThoughtPromptingElicits2023","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2201.11903","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,10]]},"number":"arXiv:2201.11903","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903"},

  {"id":"wilsonAestheticTechnicalStrategies2023","abstract":"Networked music is no longer a future genre: the global quarantine event of 2020 launched the concept of performing together over the Internet into the mainstream. While the demand for performing at a distance may be a new imperative, musicians find themselves faced with technological and performative processes that do not appear to be suitable for performing music together online, due particularly to network latency which disrupts the ability for musicians to synchronize. The research presented in this paper investigates and challenges the reasons why networked music is not readily embraced by musicians and describes how that might change, by way of interviews with practitioners and an in-depth review of the technical constraints. Limitations that might cause frustration are in fact shown to have creative strategies that give rise to aesthetic approaches, distinct to the platform. By exploiting the constraints, in tandem with developing technology designed specifically for remote performance, aesthetic implications arise that not only accommodate the inconveniences of latency and acoustic feedback but can help us adapt and transform how we engage in real-time online, towards a future where we can imagine performing together over even more dramatic distances such as high-latency, low-bandwidth locations outside of urban areas—or even over galactic distances.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Wilson","given":"Rebekah"}],"citation-key":"wilsonAestheticTechnicalStrategies2023","container-title":"AI & SOCIETY","container-title-short":"AI & Soc","DOI":"10.1007/s00146-020-01099-4","ISSN":"0951-5666, 1435-5655","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",10]]},"language":"en","page":"1871-1884","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Aesthetic and technical strategies for networked music performance","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00146-020-01099-4","volume":"38"},

  {"id":"wilsonGyorgyLigetiRhetoric2004","abstract":"Composers’ self-representations – in articles, programme notes, and interviews – have exerted a significant influence on twentieth-century music scholarship, shaping not only the reception of particular outputs but also wider historiographical conceptions of the recent past. This article traces one particular mode of discourse through the published statements of György Ligeti – a ‘rhetoric of autonomy’, which tends to disavow allegiances to ‘schools’ or institutions and underplay stylistic or aesthetic commonalities with the work of other composers. This type of rhetoric, together with the image it promotes of an artistic culture created out of the polarized activities of individuals, colludes naturally with the now familiar pluralist paradigm of late-twentieth-century culture, a paradigm that much postmodern theory, despite its putative deconstruction of the ‘ideology of the unique self’ (Jameson), has left largely unchallenged. Except that, for an artist such as Ligeti, the rhetoric of autonomy may no longer accomplish its objective purpose. Within a cultural sphere increasingly subsumed by the commercial, the image of the radically autonomous creator, once powerfully symbolic of a refusal of the mass market, becomes inescapably caught up in its mechanisms as an explicitly promotional tool.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Wilson","given":"Charles"}],"citation-key":"wilsonGyorgyLigetiRhetoric2004","container-title":"Twentieth-Century Music","container-title-short":"Twentieth-Century Music","DOI":"10/cpf5vd","ISSN":"1478-5722, 1478-5730","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",3]]},"language":"en","license":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms","page":"5-28","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"György Ligeti and the Rhetoric of Autonomy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S1478572204000040/type/journal_article","volume":"1"},

  {"id":"wintersExploringMusicSound2013","abstract":"Contemporary music research is a data-rich domain, integrating a diversity of approaches to data collection, analysis, and display. Though the idea of using sound to perceive scientiﬁc information is not new, using it as a tool to study music is a special case, unfortunately lacking proper development. To explore this prospect, this thesis examines soniﬁcation of three types of data endemic to music research: emotion, gesture, and corpora. Emotion is a type of data most closely associated with the emergent ﬁeld of aﬀective computing, though its study in music began much earlier. Gesture is studied quantitatively using motion capture systems designed to accurately record the movements of musicians or dancers in performance. Corpora designates large databases of music itself, constituting for instance, the collection of string quartets by Beethoven, or an individual’s music library. Though the motivations for using soniﬁcation diﬀer in each case, as this thesis makes clear, added beneﬁts arise from the shared medium of sound. In the case of emotion, soniﬁcation ﬁrst beneﬁts from the robust literature on the structural and acoustic determinants of musical emotion and the new computational tools designed to recognize it. Soniﬁcation ﬁnds application by oﬀering systematic and theoretically informed mappings, capable of accurately instantiating computational models, and abstracting the emotional elicitors of sound from a speciﬁc musical context. In gesture, sound can be used to represent a performer’s expressive movements in the same medium as the performed music, making relevant visual cues accessible through simultaneous auditory display. A specially designed tool is evaluated for its ability to meet goals of soniﬁcation and expressive movement analysis more generally. In the ﬁnal case, soniﬁcation is applied to the analysis of corpora. Playing through Bach’s chorales, Beethoven’s string quartets or Monteverdi’s madrigals at high speeds (up to 104 notes/second) yields characteristically diﬀerent sounds, and can be applied as a technique for analysis of pitch-transcription algorithms.","author":[{"family":"Winters","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"wintersExploringMusicSound2013","event-place":"Montréal","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"McGill University","publisher-place":"Montréal","source":"Zotero","title":"Exploring Music through Sound: Soniﬁcation of Emotion, Gesture, and Corpora","type":"thesis"},

  {"id":"wollnerSlowMotionFilms2018","abstract":"Slow motion scenes are ubiquitous in screen-based audiovisual media and are typically accompanied by emotional music. The strong effects of slow motion on observers are hypothetically related to heightened emotional states in which time seems to pass more slowly. These states are simulated in films and video clips, and seem to resemble such experiences in daily life. The current study investigated time perception and emotional response to media clips containing decelerated human motion, with or without music using psychometric and psychophysiological testing methods. Participants were presented with slow-motion scenes taken from commercial films, ballet and sports footage, as well as the same scenes converted to real-time. Results reveal that slow-motion scenes, compared to adapted realtime scenes, led to systematic underestimations of duration, lower perceived arousal but higher valence, lower respiration rates and smaller pupillary diameters. The presence of music compared to visual-only presentations strongly affected results in terms of higher accuracy in duration estimates, higher perceived arousal and valence, higher physiological activation and larger pupillary diameters, indicating higher arousal.

These findings suggest that perceiving slow motion is not related to states of high arousal, but rather affects cognitive dimensions of perceived time and valence.

As memory and computational constraints gain importance in embedded and mobile applications, we propose to combine Fourier methods and recurrent neural network architectures. The short-time Fourier transform allows us to efficiently process multiple samples at a time. Additionally, weight reductions trough low pass filtering is possible.

They were ﬁrstly made up of periodic unit cells that interact with electromagnetic (EM) waves to manipulate their behavior, showing extraordinary phenomena like EM cloaking, negative index, beam deﬂection and so on. In recent years, the concept of metamaterial has been penetrating in various physical domain and various metamaterials with versatile functionalities have been proposed and fabricated by 3D printing technology to manipulate the interactions between matter and electromagnetic, thermal, acoustic, and mechanical energy. With the increasing of structural complexity, material types, precision additive manufacturing serve as a powerful tool to achieve novel metamaterials with extraordinary performance and fusion of functionalities. In this paper, we reviewed the remarkable properties enabled by 3D printed metamaterials in diﬀerent ﬁelds, and analyzed the consilience relationship between structure, function, and manufacturing process.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Wu","given":"Lingling"},{"family":"Xue","given":"Jiacheng"},{"family":"Tian","given":"Xiaoyong"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Tengfei"},{"family":"Li","given":"Dichen"}],"citation-key":"wu3DprintedMetamaterialsVersatile2023","container-title":"Chinese Journal of Mechanical Engineering: Additive Manufacturing Frontiers","container-title-short":"Chinese Journal of Mechanical Engineering: Additive Manufacturing Frontiers","DOI":"10.1016/j.cjmeam.2023.100091","ISSN":"27726657","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9]]},"language":"en","page":"100091","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"3D-printed Metamaterials with Versatile Functionalities","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2772665723000302","volume":"2"},

  {"id":"xenakisPsappha1975","abstract":"“Psappha” is an archaic form of “Sappho,” a great Greek poetess from the Island of Lesbos, born in the 600’s BC. Her style was sensual and melodic, and she was one of the first poets to write from the first person, describing love and loss as it affected her personally. This emotion and sentimentality does not seem to manifest in Xenakis’ interpretation. Written for six groups of instruments, three of wood and skins and three of metal, Psappha is sharp, brittle, and even violent at times. This intensely aggressive work seems almost in contradiction to its title. The inspiration here, however, manifests not as aesthetic, but as structure. The work’s rhythmic structures are derived from small rhythmic cells characteristic of Sappho’s poetry. These rhythms pervade the entire work and make both local and large scale appearances. Much of the specifics of instrument choice is left up to the performer: Xenakis writes, “timbre serves only to clarify the rhythmic structures,” suggesting the “words” of this poem are only a secondary color to the structures that contain them.","author":[{"family":"Xenakis","given":"Ianni"}],"citation-key":"xenakisPsappha1975","issued":{"date-parts":[["1975"]]},"title":"Psappha","type":"document"},

  {"id":"yaoGroupletStructuredImage2010","abstract":"Psychologists have proposed that many human-object interaction activities form unique classes of scenes. Recognizing these scenes is important for many social functions. To enable a computer to do this is however a challenging task. Take people-playing-musical-instrument (PPMI) as an example; to distinguish a person playing violin from a person just holding a violin requires subtle distinction of characteristic image features and feature arrangements that differentiate these two scenes. Most of the existing image representation methods are either too coarse (e.g. BoW) or too sparse (e.g. constellation models) for performing this task. In this paper, we propose a new image feature representation called “grouplet”. The grouplet captures the structured information of an image by encoding a number of discriminative visual features and their spatial conﬁgurations. Using a dataset of 7 different PPMI activities, we show that grouplets are more effective in classifying and detecting human-object interactions than other state-of-theart methods. In particular, our method can make a robust distinction between humans playing the instruments and humans co-occurring with the instruments without playing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Yao","given":"Bangpeng"},{"family":"Fei-Fei","given":"Li"}],"citation-key":"yaoGroupletStructuredImage2010","container-title":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","DOI":"10.1109/CVPR.2010.5540234","event-place":"San Francisco, CA, USA","event-title":"2010 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","ISBN":"978-1-4244-6984-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",6]]},"language":"en","page":"9-16","publisher":"IEEE","publisher-place":"San Francisco, CA, USA","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Grouplet: A structured image representation for recognizing human and object interactions","title-short":"Grouplet","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5540234/"},

  {"id":"yeeProteusParadoxHow2014","abstract":"\"Proteus, the mythical sea god who could alter his appearance at will, embodies one of the promises of online games: the ability to reinvent oneself. Yet inhabitants of virtual worlds rarely achieve this liberty, game researcher Nick Yee contends. Though online games evoke freedom and escapism, Yee shows that virtual spaces perpetuate social norms and stereotypes from the offline world, transform play into labor, and inspire racial scapegoating and superstitious thinking. And the change that does occur is often out of our control and effected by unparalleled--but rarely recognized--tools for controlling what players think and how they behave. Using player surveys, psychological experiments, and in-game data, Yee breaks down misconceptions about who plays fantasy games and the extent to which the online and offline worlds operate separately. With a wealth of entertaining and provocative examples, he explains what virtual worlds are about and why they matter, not only for entertainment but also for business and education. He uses gaming as a lens through which to examine the pressing question of what it means to be human in a digital world. His thought-provoking book is an invitation to think more deeply about virtual worlds and what they reveal to us about ourselves. \"--","author":[{"family":"Yee","given":"Nick"}],"call-number":"GV1469.15 .Y44 2014","citation-key":"yeeProteusParadoxHow2014","event-place":"New Haven","ISBN":"978-0-300-19099-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"248","publisher":"Yale University Press","publisher-place":"New Haven","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"The proteus paradox: how online games and virtual worlds change us- and how they don't","title-short":"The proteus paradox","type":"book"},

Finally, I illustrate the use of interpretative notations in three examples chosen from contemporary music.

Scores from traditional repertoire employ a musical language that is so well known by composers and performers that interpretative notations become almost unidentifiable.

Ten musicians of varying background were given a deliberately constrained musical instrument, a wooden cube containing a touch/force sensor, speaker and embedded computer. Each cube was identical in construction, but half the instruments were conﬁgured for two degrees of freedom while the other half allowed only a single degree. Each musician practiced at home and presented two performances, in which their techniques and reactions were assessed through video, sensor data logs, questionnaires and interviews. Results show that the addition of a second degree of freedom had the counterintuitive e↵ect of reducing the exploration of the instrument’s a↵ordances; this suggested the presence of a dominant constraint in one of the two conﬁgurations which strongly di↵erentiated the process of appropriation across the two groups of participants.","author":[{"family":"Zappi","given":"Victor"},{"family":"McPherson","given":"Andrew P"}],"citation-key":"zappiDimensionalityAppropriationDigital2014","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Dimensionality and Appropriation in Digital Musical Instrument Design","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"zappiHackableInstrumentsSupporting2018","abstract":"This paper investigates the appropriation of digital musical instruments, wherein the performer develops a personal working relationship with an instrument that may differ from the designer’s intent. Two studies are presented which explore different facets of appropriation. First, a highly restrictive instrument was designed to assess the effects of constraint on unexpected creative use. Second, a digital instrument was created which initially shared several constraints and interaction modalities with the ﬁrst instrument, but which could be rewired by the performer to discover sounds not directly anticipated by the designers. Each instrument was studied with 10 musicians working individually to prepare public performances on the instrument. The results suggest that constrained musical interactions can promote the discovery of unusual and idiosyncratic playing techniques, and that tighter constraints may paradoxically lead to a richer performer experience. The diversity of ways in which the rewirable instrument was modiﬁed and used indicates that its design is open to interpretation by the performer, who may discover interaction modalities that were not anticipated by the designers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Zappi","given":"Victor"},{"family":"McPherson","given":"Andrew"}],"citation-key":"zappiHackableInstrumentsSupporting2018","container-title":"Frontiers in ICT","container-title-short":"Front.

  {"id":"zenoudaNewMusicalOrganology2018","abstract":"This article aims to shed light on a new and emerging creative field: “Audio Games,” a crossroad between video games and computer music. Today, a plethora of tiny applications, which propose entertaining audio-visual experiences with a preponderant sound dimension, are available for game consoles, computers, and mobile phones. These experiences represent a new universe where the gameplay of video games is applied to musical composition, hence creating new links between these two fields. In proposing to manipulate what we refer to as “a-musicological”1 representations (i.e. using symbols not normally associated with traditional musicology to manipulate and produce sound), this creative aspect raises new questions about representations of sound and musical structures and requires new instrumental gestures and approaches to composing music which will be examined. Furthermore, these objects play a role in the rise of a new amateur profile, already put forth by authors like Vilèm Flusser (Flusser, 1996), with regards to photography.","author":[{"family":"Zénouda","given":"Hervé"}],"citation-key":"zenoudaNewMusicalOrganology2018","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"New musical organology: the audio-games","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"zvonicekThreeDimensionalPrintingProcess2023","abstract":"Acoustical properties of various materials were analyzed in order to determine their potential for the utilization in the three-dimensional printing process of stringed musical instruments. Polylactic acid (PLA), polyethylene terephthalate with glycol modiﬁcation (PET-G), and acrylonitrile styrene acrylate (ASA) ﬁlaments were studied in terms of sound reﬂection using the transfer function method. In addition, the surface geometry parameters (Sa, Sq, Sz, and Sdr) were measured, and their relation to the acoustic performance of three-dimensional-printed samples was investigated. It was found that a higher layer height, and thus a faster printing process, does not necessarily mean poor acoustical properties. The proposed methodology also proved to be a relatively easy and rapid way to test the acoustic performance of various materials and the effect of three-dimensional printing parameters to test such a combination at the very beginning of the production process.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Zvoníček","given":"Tomáš"},{"family":"Vašina","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Pata","given":"Vladimír"},{"family":"Smolka","given":"Petr"}],"citation-key":"zvonicekThreeDimensionalPrintingProcess2023","container-title":"Polymers","container-title-short":"Polymers","DOI":"10.3390/polym15092025","ISSN":"2073-4360","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,24]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"2025","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Three-Dimensional Printing Process for Musical Instruments: Sound Reflection Properties of Polymeric Materials for Enhanced Acoustical Performance","title-short":"Three-Dimensional Printing Process for Musical Instruments","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/15/9/2025","volume":"15"},
