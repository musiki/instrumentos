Paul Tingen  (1996)

*Si has oído hablar del IRCAM de París, probablemente imagines que es un búnker de investigación financiado por el gobierno y dedicado a un tipo de experimentación sonora y musical de vanguardia que tiene poca relevancia para el músico medio de alta tecnología. En los últimos años, sin embargo, como descubre Paul Tingen, el IRCAM ha ido bajando a la tierra, y un nuevo espíritu de apertura y conciencia comercial da forma ahora a su trabajo.*

En pleno centro de París se levanta el Centro Nacional de Arte y Cultura, más conocido como Centro Georges Pompidou. Cualquiera que haya visitado los lugares turísticos de París recordará este edificio: es así de extraño. Sin embargo, pocos se habrán dado cuenta de que justo a su lado se llevan a cabo algunos de los trabajos más avanzados y serios del mundo en un campo que es de interés primordial para el lector de esta revista. Y es que este prestigioso lugar es la residencia del IRCAM, o Instituto de Investigación y Coordinación en Acústica y Música. Este instituto es legendario en el mundo de la música clásica por ser pionero de la música de vanguardia generada por ordenador, pero curiosamente es muy desconocido o ignorado en el mundo de la música popular. Y si usted trabaja en el campo de la música popular y ha oído hablar del IRCAM , es probable que su nombre le evoque imágenes de científicos con bata blanca que trabajan con compositores clásicos con gafas y barba de chivo en ordenadores caseros, creando chirridos atonales que tienen poca relevancia para la mayoría de nosotros.

A pesar de su imagen de torre de marfil, dos décadas después de su fundación por Pierre Boulez, el compositor francés más vanguardista, el IRCAM sigue siendo único en el mundo.

Sin embargo, esta imagen es bastante injusta; el concepto original del IRCAM -unir a científicos y artistas en la búsqueda de nueva música- era, y es, verdaderamente visionario. Puede que el estudio y sello discográfico[ Real World](https://realworldstudios.com/) de Peter Gabriel persiguiera un objetivo similar, pero su credo se estableció casi una década más tarde ("...desarrollando nuevas formas de colaboración entre artistas de todo tipo y tecnólogos") y sus resultados son mucho menos radicales y revolucionarios. A pesar de seguir lastrado por su imagen de torre de marfil dos décadas después de su fundación por el compositor clásico de vanguardia número uno de Francia, Pierre Boulez, el IRCAM sigue siendo único en el mundo. La inversión de grandes sumas de dinero por parte del gobierno francés en algo tan "lejano" como la música electroacústica y por ordenador fue loable y clarividente. 

Sin embargo, con la financiación gubernamental a buen recaudo, el IRCAM pareció cerrar sus puertas al mundo exterior y se dedicó a desarrollar grandes e inusuales ordenadores productores de música que tenían poca relevancia para cualquiera que no trabajara en el campo de la música clásica de vanguardia. Sin embargo, en el proceso desarrollaron tecnologías, como el procesamiento digital de señales (DSP) en tiempo real y el modelado físico, que acabaron teniendo un gran impacto también en el campo de la música popular.

Momentum For Change
IRCAM today is becoming more interesting and relevant to anyone working with electronic music than ever before. The institute abandoned the development and construction of its own computers in the early '90s, and after a period of using Next and Silicon Graphics computers, IRCAM personnel now work almost exclusively on the Macintosh platform, dedicating much of the institute's time and resources to developing DSP and graphics software for the Mac. Three years ago, IRCAM began to make much of this software available to outside users via their user‑group, called Forum (see 'IRCAM Forum' box). The software available via this user group clearly benefits from IRCAM's unique 20 years of experience in the field, and includes physical modelling, virtual acoustics simulation and directionality packages. IRCAM's new openness and relevance to the outside world have also been driven by the appointment of a new, dynamic young director, Laurent Bayle, who took over from Pierre Boulez in 1992, and by the dramatic breaking down of boundaries between different musical styles, disciplines and cultures that has been happening everywhere during the last decade.

New Spirit
The Finnish musicologist Risto Nieminen has been IRCAM's artistic director since 1991: part of his brief is overseeing the choice of young composers that come to study at IRCAM, and organising the 80‑odd concerts that IRCAM is involved in every year around the world. In a large, airy and light‑filled office in a building called the Piano Tower, he muses about the dramatic changes that are affecting IRCAM: "There's been a big change here since Laurent Bayle became director, that's true. But it's also true that many of these changes were part of a natural evolution. Twenty years ago it was much more difficult to collaborate and communicate with other art forms and we had to build computers that made sounds from scratch ourselves, because they didn't exist yet. That was a pioneering phase, during which we had to invent and build everything in‑house, and it was natural that we were closed and didn't have a lot of contact with the outside world.

"Then, when we switched to the Next computer in the early '90s and built the IRCAM Workstation, or Black Box, then later switched to the Mac, it was suddenly possible for IRCAM to communicate much more easily with other studios and performance bodies. We didn't need to drive a truck with a huge computer inside any more, to play a piece somewhere, and we didn't need to bring specialist technicians along. It's now much easier for us to do outside collaborations and still maintain our artistic standards. This is also reflected in the Forum, our user group. The fact that much of our software is now available to anyone who has a good Mac means that we don't have, and don't want, control any more over the kind of music that is made with our technologies. IRCAM technology is now used to make a wide variety of music. This also reflects the fact that different music styles have become much more integrated in general. In the '70s, music styles were very segmented, we had one aesthetic here and a composer couldn't do much else. Now composers feel free to mix different styles, whether classical, avant‑garde, rock, jazz or world music."

Computers have taken a lot of energy from people in recent years, so that they have little left for creativity, and we try to reverse that trend...
One of the most far‑reaching changes initiated by Laurent Bayle, a 45‑year old former theatre and festival director and former artistic director at IRCAM, was to set up a department called 'Valorisation', a word that translates as 'to promote', 'to develop' or 'to put to good use'. Valorisation started in 1993, and its aims radically changed the working methods at IRCAM. The information and technology transfer expert Vincent Puig was made director, and he initiated not only Forum, but also numerous institutional contacts with the outside world, which led to many industrial and commercial applications of IRCAM‑developed technology, some of them quite spectacular. Puig remembers the new wind that blew through IRCAM: "Laurent gave many impulses for new ideas and for a new spirit, in the sense that we opened the doors to the public and offered much more information to it. He also pushed to make our education department much bigger and attracted a new director for our R&D department, Hugues Vinet, who was the developer of GRM Tools, a Digidesign plug‑in, and who comes from the development rather than the research side. This made a big change in our working methods too."

Puig acknowledges the existence of IRCAM's ivory tower image, and asserts that "there's a conscious effort to change that, but it's difficult to erase an image that's been around for so long and that's very strong. But we are trying to make everything available that we research and develop here, and have much more contact with the outside world. We have to do that to survive. Forum, for example, was partly set up to get feedback from the users. They get very early versions of our software, and their feedback is essential, not only to improve the software, but also to make better manuals and documentation and provide everything that comes with regular commercial software: training, service, and so on. So there's been a real change in the spirit of our development. In the past it was more a matter of the R&D team coming up with technological developments and the composers waiting to find out what was presented to them and then seeing how they could apply it. There were, of course, discussions between composers and researchers — and occasional battles and confrontations — and some very interesting things came out of this. But now the work is structured in teams of composers, users, students and researchers working together in development groups for specific projects. The researchers are not just doing their own thing any more, but are also answering the needs that are expressed in these groups."

...IRCAM continues to play an important role in the increasingly fast‑moving world of computer and DSP technology...
The youthful director of R&D at IRCAM, Hugues Vinet (34), tells me that these development groups are for subjects such as acoustics, real‑time systems, on‑line studios, analysis/synthesis and DSP, information systems, and so on. Within these, there are two strategies: "One level is where a user has a specific need and we try to adapt software to his or her needs. That's a short‑term development. But there are also longer‑term strategies that deal with designing brand‑new software in response to people's needs, and examining at a higher level all the problems that occur when people spend time with technology — how they lose time converting formats, or with badly‑designed interfaces and so on — and we try to integrate these findings into our software developments. The fact that our software is now available to the outside world also requires a different organisation of the R&D department, because we now have to guarantee a certain level of quality and we have to support the software in the long term."

Another aspect of going public with its technological developments is that IRCAM has to keep a close eye on the movements of the commercial players in the field, such as Opcode, Steinberg, Digidesign, and so on. Presumably IRCAM chooses what software to develop on the basis of what it perceives as its specific strengths. Asked what these are, Vinet stresses first and foremost "the people we have here at IRCAM. We have a dynamic team with many brilliant people who have been here for a long time and who are well‑connected to the scientific community around the world. We know all the top researchers working in this area, and you can count them on the fingers of two hands. The second thing is that we do both research and development. Companies like Opcode and Digidesign are developers who apply the results of the research. They're not interested in everything we do, but take from researchers what they want. So we are the originators. At the same time, many researchers aren't connected to developers, let alone users. We have a close relationship between research and development here, which is a unique situation in the world, and on top of that we also work in close communication with composers and other users."

Expression
Vinet stresses that this close connection between research, development and user still forms the core and raison d'etre of IRCAM: "The chain between research and useable software is not always easy to create. We try to have as much communication as possible, and a number of composers work here every year to help with scientific research and give our development teams feedback. For example, when giving feedback on new software, they may either make a set of musical sketches with it, to evaluate it from a musical point of view, or they make what we call a tutorial, a set of musical examples that demonstrates the whole range, from the easiest way to use the tool to the most complex way, so that other people can try it out and get trained. Composers are very demanding — time‑stretching came out of the needs articulated by avant‑garde composers, for example. Because of these high demands, the tools we develop usually are very complex. But we don't want to force users into having to adapt their music to the parameters of our technology.

Forum, the IRCAM user‑group, was set up in 1993 and marked one of the most far‑reaching changes in policy and direction in the institute's history.
"Computers have taken a lot of energy from people in recent years, so that they have little left for creativity, and we try to reverse that trend and make our tools as transparent and easy to use as possible, so that people can concentrate on music, rather than technology. Developing good graphic interfaces is an important part of this. We have to identify our specialities in the work that we do, and we have decided that they lie mainly in the area of developing software tools for composers to work with, developing interfaces for inputting information into a computer that comes from gestures, movements, playing and so on, and designing musician‑friendly graphic interfaces. These are ways of introducing meaning into computers and keeping a musician's work away from equations and computations and needing to be a technical expert. Technology must be at the service of the composer's or performer's expression, and I think that musicians who have something to say will try to hide technology rather than show it."

The successes which IRCAM is having in achieving these aims do not mean that the institute will soon follow in the footsteps of the big commercial players in the music technology field. Puig, Nieminen and Vinet all stressed the fact that IRCAM works within the constraints of government funding, and artistic considerations take precedence. Vinet: "The industry can do mass production and marketing much better than us. We're simply not set up to do that. We therefore concentrate on high‑level technology, which we try to licence to any of the major companies, who can either adapt our technology to their own needs, or produce it exactly as we made it, as Opcode did with MAX." Puig: "The only place where we ourselves make our technologies directly available to larger amounts of users is via Forum, which is commercial, or with the few bits of hardware that we make."

Fun
To the same question about IRCAM's particular strengths, Vincent Puig points to the wealth of data that the institute has accumulated during 20 years of acoustic testing, and describes how this has given rise to some very peculiar bits of software, available via Forum: "You cannot imagine all the measurements of instruments that we have here, done in our anechoic chamber or in the concert hall. It's incredible, and they, and the know‑how and studies that we've built up during 20 years, are now being applied for physical modelling in software like Modalys. You can build your own virtual instrument with Modalys, and we also use it for industrial applications. For example, a company came to us asking us to design a sound for their future electric cars, and we're working with France Telecom on designing a new acoustic for teleconferences. We've also used our computer experience and acoustic data to create 3D software called the Spatialisateur. It has an interface that's designed for musicians, and with it you can create illusions of distance, brightness, presence, placing and even out‑of‑speaker placing." (see 'IRCAM Forum' box). One groundbreaking commercial application of IRCAM's acoustic and computer know‑how was their fantasy creation of the voice of a castrato for the movie Farinelli: Il Castrato, in 1994, by skilfully blending and colouring the voices of a counter‑tenor and a coloratura soprano. Another notable achievement is the breakthrough of the aforementioned MAX software, as marketed by Opcode, and apparently Oberheim are close to releasing IRCAM‑developed software for the Mac, based on additive synthesis, which allows, for instance, the sound of someone playing the guitar to be remodelled into another sound, with the added option to morph between the two sounds. It works in real time, and a pedal to establish the morph point between the two sounds is part of the system. IRCAM are also looking for a partner with whom they can make their amazing directionality software, which alters the directional characteristics of sounds, commercially available.

All these developments demonstrate that IRCAM continues to play an important role in the increasingly fast‑moving world of computer and DSP technology, and that their ivory tower image is as defunct as the monster computers they made more than a decade to go. Clearly, IRCAM remains as outrageous and revolutionary as it was 20 years ago. Moreover, it appears that a lot of the technology they produce is now not only highly practical, but also fun — and maybe even hip...

A Brief History Of IRCAM
It was in 1970 that the then‑French president Georges Pompidou asked Pierre Boulez to set up an institute dedicated to musical, acoustic and computer research, to be linked to the Centre Georges Pompidou. Building work started in 1973 underneath the Place Igor‑Stravinsky, and the underground premises were inaugurated in 1978. This oldest section of IRCAM contains the huge and revolutionary Espace de Projection, with a floor area of 375 square metres and unique prismatic modules, called periacts, which can be rotated to display different acoustic surfaces (absorbent, reflecting and diffusing). The underground area also contains the anechoic chamber, eight recording studios, and eight laboratories, plus the offices for the R&D and Valorisation departments.

During the '70s, IRCAM built the 4A computer, the first DSP workstation, and created the first version of a computer program called Chant, which synthesized sounds modelled on singing; a modernised version of this is still part of the Forum portfolio. Son of 4A, the 4X, was completed in 1981, and the MAX and Modalys softwares came to fruition in 1988. IRCAM started the '90s with a spectacular extension above the ground, the Piano Tower, named after its architect, Renzo Piano. Comprising 728 square metres, with huge amounts of glass, it now houses general services, communications, artistic and general direction offices.

In 1991, IRCAM switched over to commercial computers as its platform, with the Next computer, resulting in the Ircam workstation, or Black Box. This important move was followed by Laurent Bayle's introduction as director and a resuming of IRCAM's publishing activities the year after. The institute was now going overground in more than one sense. The user group Forum was set up in 1993, and the move to Macintosh followed a year later. 1996 saw yet another huge extension to IRCAM's premises, with the opening of L'école Jules‑Ferry et Les Bains Douches, a whopping 1969 square metres of space created by the renovation of an adjacent old building. It gives space for conference halls, the expanded Education and Music Creation department, and archiving space, made accessible to the public via the hi‑tech Médiathèque.

IRCAM'S Open Door: Forum
Forum, the IRCAM user‑group, was set up in 1993 by IRCAM's then‑new marketing director, Vincent Puig, and marked one of the most far‑reaching changes in policy and direction in the institute's history. Through Forum, IRCAM‑developed technologies became available to everyone in the outside world, not just the chosen few who were selected by IRCAM.

IRCAM Forum offers its private and institutional members a selection of specialist and highly‑advanced software that uses the Macintosh as a platform (Forum is a registered Apple User Group). One of IRCAM's main aims in setting up Forum was to get feedback on the development of its own technologies from a wide variety of people — which was considered the only way to be able to remain cutting edge in relation to the fast‑moving technologies of the outside world.

Forum is organised into three thematic groups: Computer Aided Composition, Analysis/Synthesis, and Real Time, and different software programs are available through each of them.

COMPUTER AIDED COMPOSITION.
"Making software an intelligent collaborator for writing music is the main focus of this group", states the Forum information pack. Vincent Puig comments: "The members are mainly composers who use notation to make music. The software in this group consists of intelligent tools to allow you to manipulate a score, to manipulate musical structures, and this is not only for composers who work with notes/pitches, but also for composers who work with existing sounds. The software that's offered is called Patchwork, and it allows composers to graphically represent even very abstract sounds. There is no other software available which combines this with the music notation world. It's a very powerful tool. The members of this user group tend to come more from the classical music field, and they use the software for algorithmic composition, working with the symbolisation of music, not working directly on the sound. Patchwork also includes extensive libraries, which partly come from the users themselves."
ANALYSIS/SYNTHESIS
IRCAM say that "Inventing new sounds through creative use of powerful analysis methods is the main theme for this group". The software offered through this user group offers a wealth of sound analysis and synthesis technologies, made accessible by highly intuitive and editable graphic representations. Puig offers some clarification: "The members of this group, mostly studios and sound designers, work directly on sound. The latter group are sometimes people who're not really musicians in the normal sense of the word — they just want to create special effects or invent new sounds."
Three kinds of software are offered. Audiosculpt is, explains Puig "software with which you can display an image of the sound on your screen and then intuitively shape or sculpt it, to manipulate the sound. It's based on Super Phase Vocoder (SVP) technology, and includes DSP options like filtering, time‑stretching, transpositions and morphing. You use it in conjunction with sample software on the Mac, such as Alchemy, and then you apply Audiosculpt as the processing device. It's used in composition, sound design, special effects [the castrato voice in Farinelli was created using SVP technology], mixing and post production."

The second type of software offered through this user‑group is Modalys, considered to be one of the most important fruits of IRCAM's 20 years of acoustic research. Based on a technique known as modal analysis (and originally created in 1988 on UNIX machines) Modalys makes it possible to create the sound of virtual instruments from scratch, using parameters that relate to the physical sound and sound‑production mechanisms of real instruments, but which are not limited by the constraints of the real world. It is, for example, possible to "construct a gong whose size changes over time" according to the Forum description, or morph two sounds together. Puig: "It's the most complicated of our software to use at the moment, because it has a very poor graphical interface. The problem is: how do you represent a virtual instrument on screen, like a gong that's 100 metres in diameter? Because the point of this software is not to try to re‑create an existing instrument, but to create a non‑existing one. We're working on a new interface, which should be available early next year, and which will probably be of a 3D graphic nature."

Chant is the third type of software available from this user‑group. First developed in 1979 to analyse and resynthesize the human singing voice, the modern version casts its net much wider, using paremeters based on the simulated physical methods used by the human body to create any kind of sound. Puig: "It can be used to create any kind of sound or instrument, but still works best for different types of voice synthesis, especially vowels. It works a little like FM synthesis, but it's a very abstract system. This autumn we will be bringing out another voice‑based synthesis program, called Diphone. It's mainly meant to process samples and has specific tools for morphing, and an improved algorithm for additive synthesis that will make it very powerful to use for musicians."

REAL TIME
The software from this user group is designed for live, interactive purposes. To make the computer follow the performer, rather than the other way around, has long been a prime objective of IRCAM. Puig: "This group doesn't only deal with applications for live performance, but also visual arts and real‑time interactions in virtual reality and sound installations. The main software in this group is MAX, which is marketed by Opcode as well. The Opcode version is capable of generating and processing MIDI data, and the Forum version also has real‑time DSP. It's become the industry standard for multimedia installations, and has a graphical language that allows you to patch in all kinds of different types of MIDI or live sound events."
The second type of Real Time software is FTS (Faster Than Sound), "a basic server for real‑time control and digital signal processing", which usually works in conjunction with other software. FTS is the engine for the third software from this group, Spatialisateur, which is dubbed "a real‑time virtual acoustics simulation environment", and is not to be confused with the 3D sound processing box called the Spatializer. Spatialisateur is also a 3D software of sorts, and because of its extreme processing demands, it runs on a Silicon Graphics platform, but will be available on the Mac from early next year. Puig: "This software also comes from the results of years and years of taking acoustic measurements, and allows the user not only to create localisation and surround sound effects, but also to adjust parameters like distance, brightness, liveness, sound presence, and so on. It goes way beyond any of the other 3D systems on the market at the moment. The new [Mac] interface will be made for musicians, rather than physicians, and it's a great tool for live purposes and during final mixes in the studio. We're negotiating with other companies to have it released as a studio effects box, and we're also talking to virtual reality companies about it, trying to make them aware that as they create visual illusions — like walking through a room — they also need the corresponding aural illusion, like the minor changes in acoustics that happen with every step you take in a room. Believe it or not, VR sound is still mono most of the time, and people who create VR weren't even aware that 3D virtual sound is essential for creating realistic VR, let alone that it is possible to create such aural illusions."

Forum is non‑commercial, which is reflected in the low price at which the software is made available: for individuals, it's 1750FF (around £220), for one user group, 2850FF (around £350) for two, and 3800FF (around £470) for all three. For institutions, the prices are 4700FF, 5800FF, and 6800FF respectively. These fees provide access to all the software relevant to the user group of which one is a member, plus technical support and reduced rates for the training sessions and bi‑annual workshops that Forum also offers. On top of this, Forum supplies information about new technologies and new music, including via the Internet. Forum currently has about 300 individual users, and 900 institutional users, with the largest group of users being in the UK.

IRCAM Hardware
There was a time when IRCAM was heavily into making hardware, which tended to be very big and very expensive. Today, IRCAM produces only small hardware products, like quarter‑tone modifications for flutes, special mutes for trumpets and horns, and a mouthpiece for a clarinet which allows the player to change volume and pitch with a foot pedal. On the electronic front, IRCAM have also been perplexed by the irritating habit of hard disks to make a racket, and have developed something which they call a Mac Motus: this is simply a signal modification/amplification box and high‑quality cables which allow you to place your hard drive and computer up to 150 metres from screen and keyboard. Since it's in low‑volume production only, the price is sadly rather steep: 5000FF (around £600!). Finally there's the IRCAM mouse, called Felix. It plugs in on top of one's ordinary mouse, hence the name, and gives the user 3D capabilities, helpful for 3D games, internet, and 3D graphic sound representations.

The Institute Today
In 1995, IRCAM's budget was 42.6 million francs, (about £5.3 million), of which 31 million francs came from the French ministry of culture. The remainder was supplied by income from concerts, workshops, education, publications, CDs, Forum, licensing fees and industrial partnerships. Outgoings were divided between R&D (£1.8 million), education (£1.8 million), music creation/production (£600,000), and general services (£1.2 million).

Almost all the institute's current activities are described at some length in the main article and the Forum box. However, three areas have hardly been touched upon, and these are Education, Music Creation and the Médiathèque. Jean Baptiste Barrière is director of the Education and Music Creation department, and he explains: "In Music Creation, we do everything to call a piece of music into being other than composing it — we record the music and feed the composer, and so on, which is why I prefer to call it Music Production. The education side was for a while separate and has now been joined together again, and we now have a complete educational program, with a couple of PhD degrees, one‑year programs for composers, and 16 weekend workshops that cover everything from computer composition to sound sculpting. The R&D department looks after about 20people who do research for their post‑graduate degrees."

Barrière is responsible for the eight studios that are housed largely in the original underground building, and the four studios that are in the top of the Piano Tower. All studios are equipped with similar equipment — a Mac with Pro Tools, SampleCell and all IRCAM software, a Next Computer — the Black Box — with Spatialisateur software, a Yamaha FM keyboard such as an SY99 or SY77, custom‑made Amadeus monitors, outboard effects‑processing gear, Tascam DA30 DATs, and Sony or EMT desks. The studios are used almost exclusively for sound‑sculpting and composition, with the exception of Studio 8, which is also a genuine recording studio, featuring a Neve desk and a Studer 48‑track digital recorder.

The Médiathèque, housed in the recently opened Jules Ferry and Bains‑Douches building, is basically a computer‑driven music archive and library. It contains around 15,000 books, 8000 scores, and 2500 recordings by the Ensemble Contemporain — although independent, this is more or less IRCAM's house orchestra — plus many recordings by others. All this material is accessible via computer terminals, and a catalogue is available on IRCAM's website. The Médiathèque is open four days a week to members, at 300FF per year — Forum members 200FF and students 150FF
