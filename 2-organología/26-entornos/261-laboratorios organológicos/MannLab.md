Professor Steve Mann is widely regarded as the Father of Wearable Computing, having created the world's first wearable augmented reality computer more than 40 years ago. [1]  Mann is the inventor of the smartwatch [2], digital eye glass [3], and high dynamic range imaging (HDR) [4], which is used in nearly every digital camera and smartphone today, including the iPhone.

MannLab researches, develops and commercializes the inventions of Professor Mann and his closest collaborators.  With locations in Toronto, Canada, Shenzhen, China, and Silicon Valley, California, MannLab is a global ecosystem, where entrepreneurs, professors, students, product designers, engineers, and creative visionaries of all kinds have come together to shape how humans and technology will interface for the next 40 years, and beyond.
